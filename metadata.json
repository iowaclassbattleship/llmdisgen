    "actual_discussion": "The UK cancer clinical guidelines are sufficient in number and variety to provide a fair window on the impact of cancer research on clinical practice, not only in the United Kingdom, but in other leading countries, particularly in western Europe. We have seen that almost all the references (88%) are to papers that are within the subfield of cancer research. Because about one-third of the research supported by Cancer Research UK, in common with that of other medical research charities working in a particular disease area, is out with this subfield (most of this would comprise basic biology), it follows that little of this work can be expected to influence clinical guidelines -hardly a surprising conclusion, but nevertheless one that is worth stating.Many of the guideline references are to papers in the US and the UK general medical journals -The Journal of the American Medical Association, New England Journal Medical, British Medical Journal and The Lancet. This is one reason, but by no means the only one, for the guideline references as a whole to be in high impact, and therefore well known, journals. It appears that if researchers want their work, particularly clinical trials, to be part of the evidence base for clinical guidelines, then it is desirable for them to publish in highly cited journals. Disproportionately, many of these papers will have been funded by government or the pharmaceutical industry, with charities also playing an enhanced role compared with cancer research overall. This highlights one pitfall of national guidelines in the context of research impact assessments; many important, high quality clinical trials -either because they are early phase or negative -will not make it into guidelines. The impact of research on national clinical guidelines is just one parameter that can describe the utility of health research {{9662045}} Table 4.When account is taken of the clinical nature of the work cited on guidelines, the big increase in the percentage of the papers that acknowledge funding -whether from government, charities or industry -is striking (Table 5). Many (37%) of these clinical papers with RLs greater than 1.5 are reports of clinical trials, and 85% of the latter acknowledge funding compared with 71% of the others. Cancer Research UK plays the biggest role, and supports over one-third of these trials, more even than the pharmaceutical industry as a whole, or the UK government.The geographical analysis of the cited papers reveals that the UK papers have a threefold higher presence among them than in world cancer research. In part, this reflects the differences in cancer management between countries. Such overcitation also occurs on other scientific papers, so it is hardly surprising that it was found here. It might be expected that the UK guidelines, which aim to show which treatments are cost-effective, would reflect in particular the different financial basis of health-care provision in this country compared with that elsewhere, and so papers concerned with economics and costs would be even more overcited if they were from the United Kingdom. In fact, this does occur, but to a very minor extent (22% from the United Kingdom compared with 19% overall; the difference not being significant).The distribution of the cited papers within the United Kingdom differs from what might have been expected based purely on overall numbers and on the extent to which the cities carry out clinical observation rather than basic research. The simple comparison of Figure 4 needs also to take account of the mean RL of papers from each area, and, when this is done ( Figure 5), a different pattern emerges, with EH \u00bc Edinburgh, OX \u00bc Oxford and CB \u00bc Cambridge forming an axis of excellence (on this indicator) and other areas' output being less cited on guidelines. The distance of the spots from this axis gives one indicator of the performance of the different centres, an imperfect one to be sure, as there will be other confounding factors not considered here, but nevertheless a useful complement to the traditional bibliometric criterion based purely on citation counts in the scientific literature.There are in the database enough cited papers from a few other countries to enable a similar evaluation to be carried out for them. However, these data are inevitably skewed by being viewed through the prism of the UK clinical recommendations. It would be highly desirable to complement them with the results of similar exercises carried out in other countries with extensive sets of clinical guidelines, or at a European or international level. Then, provided the data were collected in exactly the same way, they could be pooled and a more international perspective on the utility of cancer research would emerge that research evaluators could employ. Such an activity could appropriately be coordinated by the European Cancer Managers' Research Forum, with all data contributors having also the right to gain access to the data provided by workers in other countries.",

    "actual_discussion": "We found the corresponding counterparts of meron and elliptic solutions of Euclidean O(3) non-linear sigma model in the Pohlmeyer reduced version of the same theory, namely the sinh-Gordon equation. Summarizing, we may conclude the following: Instanton solutions, which are the only finite action solutions of the O(3) model, do not have a counterpart, as they are characterized by vanishing stress-energy tensor. Therefore, not every solution of the non-linear sigma model has a counterpart in the Pohlmeyer reduced theory. Especially solutions with a well defined topological number cannot be mapped to the Pohlmeyer reduced theory, as they have to be characterized by a unique limit at complex infinity, which is inconsistent with the form of the imposed Virasoro constraint in Pohlmeyer reduction.All meron solutions correspond to the ground state of the sinh-Gordon equation. It seems that this is a more general property that singular configurations such as a meron have. In a similar manner, strings propagating into R t \u00d7 S 2 are described by a non-linear sigma model that is reducible to the sine-Gordon equation. Classical string solutions that are singular in a similar sense (the world-sheet tends to an onedimensional manifold, such as a point particle solution, or the \"hoop\" string solution) have the property of being mapped to either the stable or the unstable vacuum of the sine-Gordon equation {{12750838}}.Elliptic solutions, which can be viewed as solutions of an one-dimensional mechanical pendulum problem in the initial formulation of the theory, have also an onedimensional mechanical analogue with a hyperbolic cosine potential in the Pohlmeyer reduced description. For every periodic solution in the pendulum problem, there is a quasi-periodic solution and vice versa that has the same counterpart in the hyperbolic cosine problem. The above pair of solutions correspond to physically distinct solutions in the initial formulation of the sigma model. Furthermore, different, physically inequivalent solutions of the sigma model may correspond to the same solution in the Pohlmeyer reduced theory. This may be attributed to the fact that Pohlmeyer reduction deals with the fields and their derivatives in a symmetric way, as elements of a vector basis in an enhanced higher dimensional space, in our case R 3 .It would be interesting to generalize these results studying the correspondence between solutions of non-linear sigma models with different target space geometries or in higher dimensional target spaces.",

Write a discussion for this:The paper \"The Euclidean O(3) Non-linear Sigma Model\" by A. Kac and A. Pohlmeyer is a classic work in the field of integrable systems. The authors introduce the Euclidean O(3) non-linear sigma model, which is a non-linear sigma model in the sense of the theory of integrable systems. The model is defined on the space of functions on the unit circle, and the action is given by a sum of terms of the form \u222bd(x)e(x^2+y^2)dx. The authors prove that the model is integrable, and that the equations of motion are given by the sine-Gordon equation. The paper is a landmark in the field of integrable systems, and has had a significant impact on the development of the theory. The paper is also a classic in the field of mathematical physics, and has been widely studied and applied in various contexts.

    "actual_discussion": "Overall, the distributional similarity between the target word and the synonym candidates represents the strongest extension of the basic retranslation approach, and the cluster graphs do not provide further useful information. A breakdown of the cluster analyses revealed that the cluster sizes are very unevenly distributed. Typically, there is one very large cluster and several considerably smaller clusters, as shown by the first part of  Table 4: Distribution of candidates, synonyms and senses in the largest cluster vs. all other clusters in the iterations T 1 -T 5 .proportion of candidates in the remaining clusters.In addition, we found that most correct synonyms are also in the largest cluster (middle part of table 4). Accordingly, the cluster analyses do not represent partitions of the target verb senses, but most senses are in the largest cluster (bottom part of table 4).Consequently, while the synonym features are useful for ranking the set of candidates, clusterlevel features are ineffective as they are derived from effectively meaningless cluster analyses. 4 While re-applying the clustering step gradually overcomes the uneven cluster distribution (iterations T 2 -T 5 in table 4), the sizes of the graphs decrease dramatically. For example (not depicted in table 4), on average there are only 169 candidates left in T 5 compared to 1,792 in T 1 , with an average of 2.8 correct synonyms instead of 22.5, and an average of 1.7 senses instead of 4.5.We assume that partitioning the candidate set according to senses in combination with the cluster-level measures is a valid approach to deal with the word sense problem, but based on our analysis we conclude that either (i) the context vectors are not suitable to differentiate between senses, or that (ii) the clustering algorithm is inapt for this scenario. A possible solution might be to apply the algorithms suggested in {{11942888}}. Finally, no weighting was applied to any of the properties listed in table 2. This could be improved by using a held-out data development set, and a greater number of particle verbs (we only use 138) would probably be needed as well.We hypothesized that graph-based clustering properties in addition to synonym candidate properties should improve the precision of synonym identification and ranking, and extend the diversity of synonym senses. Unfortunately, our extensions failed, and analyses of cluster properties revealed that future work should improve the vector representations and compare other clustering algorithms. One should keep in mind, however, that we focused on a specifically challenging class of multi-word expressions: highly ambiguous German particle verbs.",
