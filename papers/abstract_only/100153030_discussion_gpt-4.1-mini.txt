The results presented in this study clarify the detailed relationship between classical solutions of the Euclidean O(3) non-linear sigma model and their counterparts in the Pohlmeyer reduced framework described by the sinh-Gordon equation. Our analysis reveals that not all well-known sigma model solutions admit counterparts in the reduced theory: instantons notably lack a direct equivalent, indicating a limitation or a subtlety in the Pohlmeyer reduction when applied to topologically nontrivial configurations. This suggests that the reduction may not preserve certain topological features intrinsic to instantons, aligning with the understanding that Pohlmeyer reduction emphasizes the integrable dynamics rather than topological aspects.

In contrast, merons, which are singular solutions with half-integer topological charge, correspond to the ground state configuration in the sinh-Gordon formulation. This exact correspondence underscores that certain singular behaviors in the sigma model translate into simple vacuum-like solutions in the reduced system, reflecting how the reduction encodes minimal energy configurations of the original theory.

The study of the elliptic solutions, which interpolate between merons and instantons, uncovers a two-to-one mapping between the sigma model and sinh-Gordon solutions. This multiplicity highlights a richer structure in the correspondence, where distinct sigma model configurations can yield the same reduced solution, or conversely, a single reduced solution can arise from multiple sigma model solutions. Such behavior points to an underlying degeneracy or gauge freedom in the reduction procedure and may be connected to hidden symmetries or dualities within these integrable systems.

Our findings complement previous work on integrable string solutions and their dressing transformations, such as multi-soliton configurations in generalized sine-Gordon models discussed by earlier studies. The connection between elliptic solutions of the sigma model and sinh-Gordon solutions with multi-soliton or bound state interpretations suggests avenues to extend the dressing method framework to the Euclidean models studied here, potentially enriching the catalog of classical solutions and their physical interpretations.

Overall, this work deepens the understanding of the integrable structure relating the O(3) sigma model and the sinh-Gordon equation, emphasizing both the strengths and limitations of Pohlmeyer reduction. It opens perspectives for further investigations into how topological and singular structures manifest or disappear in integrable reductions, as well as how the solution space is organized, which may have implications for related models in string theory and condensed matter physics.
