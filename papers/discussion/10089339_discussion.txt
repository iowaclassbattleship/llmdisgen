This is the first report of a machine-learning-based method for identification of CDKI protein sequences. Previously, such approaches have been applied to the computational identification of other components of the cell cycle including cyclins {{614128}} and CDK phosphorylation substrates {{3273679}}.

Our tool simply represents a complementary tool to allow the detection of CDK inhibitors, since we prove that PFAM signatures miss a significant number of the already known CDK inhibitors  from the non-redundant set. However such machine learning based methods do come at the cost of some false positive predictions, which should be as minimal as possible. We tested this on an independent dataset comprising of randomly picked up non-CDKIs as well as kinases and phosphatases which are the most likely candidates for false positive predictions and indeed obtained a low false positive prediction rate.

In this study, we observed that SVM based methods are more efficient than ANN in discrimination of CDKI and non-CDKI sequences, despite the imbalance in the size of the positive and the negative training datasets (56 and 300 respectively). This was observed with all the types of features (Table 1 and Table 2). For an experimenter, a judicious approach would be minimizing the number of CDKIs to be characterized by increasing the threshold to higher SVM score, in order to get only the topmost candidates for further work. Supplementing these with other complementary evidence like domain knowledge and sub-cellular localization may provide inroads to the discovery of novel CDKIs and further our understanding of cell cycle regulation and other cellular phenomena. In future, the availability of more sequences and inclusion of more features may further enhance the prediction accuracy.
