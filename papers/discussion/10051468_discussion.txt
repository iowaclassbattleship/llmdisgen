These studies provide the first clear indication that blood vessels synthesize fibronectin in vivo in association with endothelial proliferation. Whereas plasma flbronectin can deposit in other sites and bathes the endothelium, we could detect no significant recruitment of circulating fibronectin into the matrix of these proliferating vessels, as has been shown in fibroblast matrices in vitro {{13161383}}. This suggests there might be a direct relationship between the observed endothelial proliferation and the increased production of fibronectin by cells in the vessel wall. Perhaps the increase in vessel wall fibronectin is an essential part of the reparative process of blood vessel basement membrane during wound healing or neovascularization.

SummaryDuring the time of tissue repair that ensues subsequent to tissue injury, blood vessel wall fibronectin increases concomitantly with endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis. However, the source of this blood vessel fibronectin had not been delineated. In this report we have demonstrated that microvascular fibronectin is produced in situ by the proliferating vessels surrounding excisional wounds. This finding was established by extirpating 3 mm of skin from the center of a well-healed rat xenograph on the flanks of immunosuppressed mice, harvesting the injured skin sites at various stages during the healing process, and staining the specimens with reciprocal speciesspecific anti-fibronectin. The proliferating donor vessels that surrounded the wounded graft had increased fluorescence staining with FITC conjugated mouse anti-rat fibronectin and no staining with rat anti-mouse fibronectin. This finding was taken as direct evidence tha[~ the fibronectin was produced in situ by the rat vessels and not derived from circulating mouse plasma.
