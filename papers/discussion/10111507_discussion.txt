In this study, we have compared the staining capacity of five anti-CD138 mAbs on human plasma cells and cells lines. We uncovered that there were significant differences between DL-101 on one side and B-A38, B-B4, and MI-15 on the other side. In fact, the anti-CD138 mAb DL-101 was weakly binding on RPMI-8226 cells, a CD138 high cell line, and was unable to stain SKW6.4 cells, a CD138 lo cell line. However, we showed that DL-101 mAb was able to stain plasma cells in bone marrow and its CD138 + cells detection frequency was similar to that of B-A38 mAb. Furthermore, by using DL-101 mAb to stain in vitro newly formed plasma cells, we revealed a high proportion of CD138 + cells, which was twofold higher than that detected with B-A38, B-B4, or MI-15 anti-CD138 antibodies. Our results also indicate that B-A38 and B-B4 can bind simultaneously to the CD138 molecules, as shown by BA + BB + and BA + DL neg cells frequencies (Figure 2(d)), suggesting that their targets are distinct and distant enough.

Our assays using the four anti-CD138 PE-conjugated mAbs ( Figure 1) suggest that DL-101's epitope might be present on all CD138 + cells stained by B-B4, MI-15, and B-A38 mAbs and also on a supplemental subset (Figure 1). Besides, the use of Alexa 647 conjugated B-A38 combined with PE-conjugated DL-101 also suggests that DL-101's epitope, when present, can overlap B-A38 mAb's epitope (Figures 2(c) and 2(d)). However, the sum of BA + DL neg and BA neg DL + cells gave a total CD138 + cell frequency similar to the one observed in Figure 1 for cells stained with DL-101 alone. DL-101 and B-A38 competition or overlap is probably also responsible for the decreased frequency of B-A38 + cells. Furthermore, the difference in staining capacity of DL-101 compared to other anti-CD138 clones on cultured cells at day 24 as well as day 19 suggests that generated plasma cells can acquire the expression of DL-101 epitope as soon as they differentiate and that they maintain also its expression. DL-101 mAb recognizes an epitope present on the core protein and can also bind to the proteoglycan form of soluble human CD138 released by A431 cells {{22068922}}. The observed staining variation between DL-101 and B-A38 was observed on myeloma cell lines characterized for their bright or weak expression of CD138 molecules. This also suggests differences in their distribution among human B cell lines. Overall, our results suggest that the availability of DL-101's epitope could be influenced by variations in the CD138 molecules' content in heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate, which could result from in vitro generation of plasma cells or depend on the origin of the cell lines or even on the microenvironment and culture medium. Our observations suggest a certain level of heterogeneity inside the in vitro generated CD138 + plasma cells. However, whether DL-101 + cells represent a distinct subset specific to in vitro culture microenvironment remains to be further investigated.

The bone marrow content of CD138 + cells were showing similar frequency of B-A38 + and DL-101 + cells, suggesting that the majority of these cells were double positive for these epitopes. Conversely, our results showing heterogeneity were obtained with fresh samples of cell lines and in vitro generated plasma cells. Therefore, we can not exclude that the DL-101 epitope may be sensitive to freezing-thawing procedure and it remains interesting but not easy to verify the possibility of heterogeneity inside the bone marrow plasma cells.

The CD138 molecule is mainly related to plasma cells and has been rarely reported to be expressed on other leucocytes. Recently, CD138 molecules have been detected on blood monocytes from patient with active systemic lupus erythematous disease (SLE) {{12309082}}. Moreover, CD138 molecules were also present on in vitro dendritic cells generated by culturing monocytes from healthy individuals in the presence of serum from those SLE patients. In view of these results, we question whether a special subset of CD138 molecules could be associated with a strong activation of the immune system, which is an important feature of our in vitro model as well as of SLE disease {{12309082}}.
