Introduction

Syndecan-1 molecules, also named CD138, are a type I transmembrane proteoglycans, which may act as coreceptors in cell adhesion and regulate several cellular functions {{24936604}}. In human lymphomas, CD138 molecules are present in isoforms of distinct molecular weight, which is dependent upon the glycosaminoglycan chains covalently attached to the core protein {{44421823}}. The CD138 marker is used in flow cytometry to identify normal or malignant plasma cells (reviewed in {{4696579}}). Several monoclonal antibodies are commercially available to detect CD138 + cells; the most currently used are the clones B-A38, B-B4, MI-15, ID4, and DL-101. These monoclonal antibodies are all of mouse origin but they differ in the source of CD138 antigen for immunization. In fact, U266, XG-1, or TH-1 cells, all CD138 + cell lines, were used as immunogens for B-A38, B-B4 {{29781541}}, MI-15 {{42972900}}, and 1D4, while recombinant syndecan-1 was used for DL-101 {{22068922}}. The B-B4 epitope is located within amino acids 90 and 93 of the core protein {{23629189}}, which is far from the heparin sulfate and chondroitin sulfate attachments sites. The binding of B-B4 on U266 cells can be inhibited by MI-15 and 1D4 in competitive assays {{44421823}}. However, the B-B4 epitope appears distinct from the epitopes of MI-15 {{42972900}} and 1D4 when tested on lymphoma samples {{23440348}}. Finally, DL-101 monoclonal antibody reacts with the native ectodomain of syndecan-1 {{22068922}}.
CD40 activation of human B lymphocytes can lead to the in vitro generation of CD138 + plasma cells {{639573}}{{220262539}}{{31676403}}{{13047122}}{{6049772}}. Such in vitro models are essential for the better understanding of B lymphocyte terminal differentiation. Since CD138 staining is crucial for the detection of newly formed CD138 + plasma cells, we have investigated the binding efficiency of five anti-CD138 monoclonal antibodies in flow cytometry analysis by comparing their capacity to detect human plasma cells.

Material and Methods

Human Cell Lines and Bone Marrow

Samples. RPMI-8226 cell line was purchased from DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) while Ramos and SKW 6.4 cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and cultured in IMDM or RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA). All cell lines were mycoplasma-free.
Bone marrow samples from healthy human were obtained from (Lonza, Walkersville, USA). These samples were received frozen and kept in liquid nitrogen vapor until flow cytometry analysis.
Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells and Switched-

Memory B Lymphocytes. This study has been approved by Héma-Québec's Research Ethics Committee and every regular platelet donor who agreed to participate in this study has signed an informed consent after the nature and possible consequences of the studies had been fully explained. Leukoreduction system (LRS) chambers from Trima Accel collection systems (Gambro BCT, Lakewood, CO, USA) were used to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as described previously {{12797807}}. CD19 + B lymphocytes were isolated from PBMNCs by negative selection using Easy-Sep CD19 cocktail and EasySep custom cocktail containing antibodies directed against IgD and IgM following manufacturer's instructions (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) {{16299435}}. B lymphocytes' purity, as determined by flow cytometry, was higher than 95%.
Human B Lymphocytes

Culture. B lymphocytes were seeded at 2 to 3 × 10 5 cells/mL in 6-well Primaria plates (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Canada) in the presence of 4 to 6 × 10 4 cells/mL -irradiated CD154 + L4.5 cells {{31676403}}. The cells were cultured in IMDM supplemented with 10% ultra low IgG FBS containing 10 g/mL insulin, 5.5 g/mL transferrin, 6.7 ng/mL sodium selenite (all from Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada), and a mix of cytokines, namely, 5 ng/mL IL-2 (∼50 U/mL), 40 ng/mL IL-10 (∼20 U/mL) (both from PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), and 3.5 ng/mL IL-4 (100 U/mL; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) {{16299435}}. On day 19, IL-6 (12.5 ng/mL) (PeproTech) was added to the medium and the cells were transferred in the presence of 1 to 1.5×10 4 cells/mL -irradiated CD154 + L4.5 cells. This second step was used to induce their differentiation into plasma cells {{31676403}} for a supplemental 5 culture days. Cell counts and viability were evaluated in triplicate by Trypan Blue exclusion using a hemocytometer. . All antibodies were used following manufacturer's instructions; more specifically for each 100 L containing about 1 × 10 6 cells, we were using 20 L of PE-conjugated 1D4, B-A38, B-B4, and MI-15 and 5 L of Alexa 647 conjugated B-A38. The volume for PE-conjugated DL-101 from eBioscience was 5 L and that for BioLegend was 20 L. Titration of DL-101 and B-A38 PE conjugated antibodies was done using RPMI-8226 cells. Staining was done for 15 to 30 minutes at room temperature in PBS and, when indicated, cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde and analyzed immediately or kept overnight at 4 ∘ C. For each sample, ≥10,000 events were gated on the FSC/SSC to analyse the cells using a Partec CyFlow ML flow cytometer (Swedesboro, NJ, USA) or Accuri C6 flow cytometer and data were subsequently analyzed using FCS Express 4.0 software (De Novo software, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Stain index was calculated using the following formula: median fluorescence intensity (MFI) obtained from the given mAb -MFI from unstained cells divided by 2 times the SD of the MFI from unstained cells. Bone marrow samples were thawed in PBS containing 50% fetal bovine serum. Sytox Blue was used to gate the viable cells in combination with CD45, CD19, and CD138 mAbs. Bone marrow cells were not fixed and analyses were done on the same day.
Statistical Analysis.

When indicated, the mean values ± standard deviations or standard error of the mean (SEM) were calculated. Gaussian distribution and variance were used to choose the adequate statistical test used to compare data as specified for each analysis. See each figure legends for details on the specific tests used, which were done using GraphPad InStat software (GraphPad software Inc, San Diego, USA).

Results

Comparison of Anti-CD138 Antibodies on RPMI-8226

Cells. RPMI-8226 is a human myeloma cell line, which expresses high levels of CD138 molecules {{46244410}}. This CD138 + cell line was stained with the five mAbs and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry with or without fixation or after an overnight period following fixation (Table 1). All anti-CD138 monoclonal antibodies staining resulted, as expected, in 100% CD138 + RPMI-8226 cells. However, the stain index comparisons showed that B-A38 had the highest stain index value; B-B4 and MI-15 were intermediate whereas DL-101 and 1D4 were showing the less efficient staining. Preliminary tests, using the reagent listed in Table 1, showed that in contrast to 1D4 mAb DL-101 mAb was however able to stain a large proportion of cultured human B lymphocytes (data not shown). Furthermore, the SI values on fixed and unfixed cells showed that the staining with the PE-conjugated antibody DL-101 was the most stable.
Variations in Detection of In Vitro Generated Plasma Cells.

Human switched-memory B lymphocytes can be expanded and differentiated into antibody secreting cells {{16299435}}, which express CD138 {{not_in_s2orc}}. We used a two-step culture model starting with a 19-day expansion, followed by 5 days in conditions favorable to differentiation. On day 24, the differentiated cells were used to test the staining capacity of B-A38, B-B4, DL-101, and MI-15 PE-conjugated anti-CD138 antibodies on de novo generated plasma cells ( Figure 1). We also tested the combination of B-A38 and DL-101 (MIX). These tests were performed using the "worst case scenario protocol" with fixation and analysis 18 h to 20 h apart. Representative profiles of CD138 + cells for all staining conditions are presented in (a) and (b); the profile for B-A38 staining is included in panels (a) and (b) to facilitate comparison. No differences were observed for CD138 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) inside the CD138 + cell populations indicating a similar binding strength for their specific target (Figure 1(c)). The use of B-A38, B-B4, and MI-15 showed a frequency of CD138 + cells varying from 23% ± 9% to 16% ± 8% (Figure 1(d)), which was as previously observed in similar culture conditions with CD19 + B cells {{31676403}}{{not_in_s2orc}}. However, when DL-101 was used alone or in combination with B-A38 (MIX) (Figures 1(b) and 1(d)), the proportion of CD138 + cells was always twofold higher than staining with B-A38, B-B4, or MI-15 alone ( < 0.001;). Such increased proportion of CD138 + cells related to DL-101 staining was also observed on day 19 within cultured B lymphocytes (data not shown) suggesting that DL101 could detect a supplemental population of emerging plasma cells.
DL-101 Binding in Human Plasma Cells.

To eliminate the possibility of unspecific binding with DL-101 mAb, we used a mix of three human B cell lines, RPMI-8226 (CD138 high ), SKW6.4 (CD138 lo ), and Ramos (CD138 neg ), which were stained with PE-conjugated B-A38, DL-101, and both mAbs (Figure 2(a)). In all three staining conditions, Ramos cells were found negative and RPMI-8226 cells were found positive. However, the binding of DL-101 to SKW6.4 was very weak suggesting that its epitope, which is on the core protein {{22068922}}, might be masked by glycosaminoglycan on this cell line. We also confirmed that the DL-101 was not giving any unspecific binding in human CD19 + blood cells (Figure 2(b), = 4) as well as for CD3 or whole CD45 populations (data not shown). Finally, to compare the binding of DL-101 and B-A38 on differentiated human B lymphocytes Alexa 647 conjugated B-A38 was combined with PE-conjugated B-B4 or PE-conjugated DL-101 (Figures 2(c) and 2(d)). The cellular profiles for five independent experiments showed that B-A38 and B-B4 mAbs were able to bind simultaneously to the CD138 + cells. Conversely, DL-101 and B-A38 staining have resulted in two distinct CD138 + cells, namely, BA + DL neg and BA neg DL + cells. No significant difference was observed between the frequency of BA + BB + , BA + DL neg , and BA neg DL + cells for the five samples. However, the proportion of all BA + cells decreased in the presence of DL-101 clone when comparing the same samples in Figure 1 (23.3% ± 4.3%) and Figure 2 (17.4% ± 3.0%) (Paired -test, = 0.0258). Overall, DL-101 mAb appeared to detect a distinct subset of human differentiated B lymphocytes.
Bone Marrow Plasma Cells Are DL-101 Positive.

To verify whether the DL-101-CD138 + cells were present in vivo, the DL-101 staining was done on bone marrow samples ( Figure 3). The viable cells were gated to select the CD45 + cells bearing CD19 molecules, which included the CD138 + plasma cells {{35182931}}. Overall, we have detected a low frequency of CD19 + cells (≤5%, data not shown) inside the whole cell population of bone marrow samples; the majority of the CD45 + CD19 lo cells (0.5% of all cells) were as expected expressing CD138 and the frequency of these CD138 + cells was similar ( > 0.05) when using B-A38 (78.7% ± 1.2%) and DL-101 (59.3% ± 2.1%) staining indicating that plasma cells in bone marrow had both epitopes on their surface. varying from 5-fold less to up to 5-fold more quantity of antibodies as used in Table 1 and Figures 1 to 3. Titration was done for both sources of PE-conjugated DL-101 as well as B-A38 and stain index was determined as described above (Figure 4). All mAbs were staining >95% of RPMI-8226 cells. The SI profiles showed that distinctive detection of the CD138 + cell phenotype was not related to excessive quantity of DL-101 neither to insufficient B-A38 quantity. These results also confirm that DL-101 even in excess still have a very low SI compared to B-A38.      Table 1.

Conclusion

In conclusion, DL-101 and B-A38 CD138 mAbs suggest that CD138 molecules may be different in human CD138 + cell lines as well as in vitro generated plasma cells. Such possible heterogeneity detected by DL-101 may be related to the in vitro culture conditions and thus B-A38, which is widely used, remains reliable. However, the single use of DL-101 to study

12309082:Serum from patients with SLE instructs monocytes to promote IgG and IgA plasmablast differentiation


RESULTS

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by multiorgan involvement and immunological abnormalities that include aberrant autoreactive B cell responses.In SLE, elevated levels of autoantibodies, particularly those recognizing double-stranded DNA, are considered to be pathogenic (Kotzin, 1996;Arbuckle et al., 2003), as autoantibody-derived immune complexes deposit in tissues and exacerbate SLE disease pathogenesis, such as lupus nephritis (Koffler et al., 1971).
The mechanisms underlying the failure to maintain B cell tolerance in SLE remain incompletely understood.There are multiple checkpoints during B cell development, maturation, and activation that have been demonstrated to be defective in mouse lupus models (Kuo et al., 1999;Grimaldi et al., 2001Grimaldi et al., , 2002;;Santulli-Marotto et al., 2001) as well as in SLE patients (Wardemann et al., 2003;Cappione et al., 2005;Yurasov et al., 2005Yurasov et al., , 2006)).Thus, active SLE patients show elevated frequencies of autoreactive B cells in the new emigrant and mature B cell compartments (Pugh-Bernard et al., 2001;Yurasov et al., 2005Yurasov et al., , 2006)).SLE patients in clinical remission continue to show higher numbers of autoreactive mature naive B cells, although at lower frequency than patients with active disease.Thus, the treatments do not seem to restore defective early B cell tolerance checkpoints in this disease.The frequency of polyreactive IgG + memory B cells from untreated, active SLE patients seems to be similar to those of healthy controls, but at higher frequency of SLE, autoantigen-specific cells exist within this compartment in some patients (Mietzner et al., 2008).Altered tolerance check points have also been described in the lymphoid organs of SLE patients, as autoreactive B cells are allowed to undergo germinal center reaction in tonsils (Cappione et al., 2005).In addition, SLE patient blood is characterized by into IgG-and particularly IgA-secreting PBs through conventional as well as novel pathways.Furthermore, blood monocytes of SLE patients showed similar functional characteristics to those of SLE-DCs.Understanding the mechanisms underlying SLE-DC-mediated B cell responses might disclose novel therapeutic targets to treat this disease.
Phenotype and morphology of SLE-DCs SLE serum induces the differentiation of healthy monocytes into DCs in an IFN--dependent manner (Blanco et al., 2001).Thus, we first compared the phenotype of DCs generated by culturing healthy monocytes with either SLE serum (SLE-DCs) or IFN- plus GM-CSF (IFN-DCs).Both SLE-DCs and IFN-DCs expressed comparable levels of HLA-DR and CD80, but SLE-DCs expressed higher levels of CD14 and CD86 (Fig. 1 A).Although this phenotype was consistent regardless of the method used to purify monocytes, neither IFN-DCs nor SLE-DCs expressed significant levels of CD83 unless monocytes were obtained by CD14 positive selection, as previously reported (Gill et al., 2002).Notably, whereas a fraction of SLE-DCs expressed CCR5 and CD163, IFN-DCs expressed low levels of CD163.Additionally, a fraction of IFN-DCs expressed CD1a (Fig. 1 A); this marker was absent on SLE-DCs.Fig. 1 B shows the percentage of CD1a + , CCR5 + , and CD163 + cells in IFN-DCs and SLE-DCs.
Giemsa staining of SLE-DCs showed the presence of dendrites.As compared with the fine projections of dendrites found in IFN-DCs, SLE-DCs had a mixture of fine and thicker dendrites (SLE-DCs 1 and SLE-DCs 2) and contained larger numbers of cytoplasmic vacuoles (Fig. 1 C).Thus, SLE-DCs B cell lymphopenia and alterations in B cell subset composition.Thus, numbers of naive B cells are decreased, whereas the frequency of CD27  memory B cells, plasmablasts (PBs), and plasma cells (PCs) is increased (Odendahl et al., 2000;Arce et al., 2001;Wei et al., 2007).However, the mechanisms underlying these alterations are not well understood.
DCs play an important role in B cell activation (Dubois et al., 1997;Jego et al., 2003) as well as in B cell tolerance (Pascual et al., 2003;Banchereau et al., 2004).Constitutive deletion of DCs in a mouse lupus model led to disease improvement (Teichmann et al., 2010), whereas their deletion in a nonautoimmune model resulted in autoimmunity (Ohnmacht et al., 2009).DCs circulate at very low levels in the blood of SLE patients (Blanco et al., 2001), and thus their ex vivo functional properties are difficult to study.Monocytes represent the most abundant circulating pool of APCs and also serve as precursors of macrophages and DCs.Indeed, blood monocytes from pediatric SLE patients act as DCs, as they induce the proliferation of allogeneic naive CD4 + T cells (Blanco et al., 2001).Furthermore, exposure of healthy monocytes to SLE serum results in the generation of cells with DC morphology and functions.This DC-inducing property of SLE serum is mainly mediated through IFN- (Blanco et al., 2001).However, SLE serum contains additional factors that might potentiate healthy monocyte differentiation into DCs (Gill et al., 2002) and eventually promote autoreactive B cell responses in patients.
In this study, we have explored the capability of SLE serum-induced monocyte-derived DCs (SLE-DCs) to promote B cell responses.Our data demonstrate that SLE-DCs are very efficient at inducing naive and memory B cell differentiation IgA-secreting B cell responses.Similar to IgD + CD27 + B cells, IgD  CD27 + memory B cells co-cultured with SLE-DCs secreted increased levels of IgG and particularly IgA (Fig. 3 B).Thus, SLE-DCs can efficiently promote both naive and memory B cell responses.
We next tested the effect of SLE-DCs on PB survival.PBs were generated by co-culturing purified total B cells and conventional monocyte-derived IL-4-DCs (monocytes cultured with GM-CSF and IL-4).These PBs were composed of IgM-(35%), IgG-(37%), and IgA-PBs (16%), as measured by surface Ig staining (not depicted).FACS-sorted total PBs (CD20  CD38 + ) were further cultured with or without SLE-DCs in the presence of IL-2 only.SLE-DCs enhanced the number of viable PBs by more than sevenfold (Fig. 3 C) and resulted in enhanced Ig secretion (not depicted).PBs exposed to SLE-DCs displayed increased levels of Bcl-X L, whereas Bcl-2 levels were not altered (Fig. 3 D).Thus, SLE-DCs can enhance B cell responses by promoting the differentiation of naive and memory B cells into PBs and by supporting PB survival and Ig secretion.

SLE-DC-mediated IgG and IgA responses are differentially regulated by B cell-activating factor (BAFF)/IL-10 and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), respectively

To understand the mechanisms whereby SLE-DCs promote IgG and IgA secretion, we tested the effects of BAFF (TNFSF13B) and APRIL (TNFSF13) on naive B cells.Both BAFF and APRIL support B cell survival as well as Ig class switching (Litinskiy et al., 2002;Xu et al., 2007).Furthermore, SLE patient serum displays elevated levels of BAFF and APRIL (Cheema et al., 2001;Koyama et al., 2005).Fig. 4 A shows that IFN-DCs and SLE-DCs, but not monocytes from healthy donors, constitutively secrete both APRIL and BAFF.In addition, SLE serum up-regulates BAFF and APRIL gene expression in monocytes in a type I IFN-dependent and -independent manner, respectively (unpublished data).
To test the effects of DC-derived BAFF and APRIL on naive B cell responses, anti-BAFF antibody and TACI-Fc were added to the 12-d co-culture of DCs and naive B cells in the presence of IL-2 and CpG.Anti-BAFF antibody neutralizes only BAFF, whereas TACI-Fc neutralizes both BAFF and APRIL.Interestingly, anti-BAFF antibody reduced the levels of IgG produced in co-cultures, whereas TACI-Fc reduced both IgM and IgA levels (Fig. 4 B,top).In contrast, neither anti-BAFF antibody nor TACI-Fc significantly altered the Ig secretion of naive B cells co-cultured with bottom).The effect of TACI-Fc or BCMA-Fc on IgG responses could not be assessed because these reagents were recognized by the anti-human IgG antibody used in the ELISA.The amount (10 µg/ml) of anti-BAFF and recombinant proteins used in this study was predetermined in separate experiments (Fig. S1). 10 µg/ml TACI-Fc efficiently decreased IgM and IgA secretion from B cells (Fig. S1 A, left and right).10 µg/ml anti-BAFF also resulted in the least amount of IgG production (Fig. S1 A, middle).In addition, anti-BAFF differ from IFN-DCs with respect to phenotype and morphology.This raised the question as to whether the two types of DCs possess distinct functions in the controlling of B cell responses.

SLE-DCs induce naive B cells to differentiate into IgG-and IgA-secreting PBs

To test the role of SLE-DCs on B cell responses, purified naive B cells (CD19 + IgD + CD27  ) were cultured with or without DCs in the presence of IL-2 and CpG.It is known that CpG promotes memory B cell proliferation and IgM production (Krieg et al., 1995;Bernasconi et al., 2002).CpG can also activate human naive B cells (He et al., 2004;Huggins et al., 2007;Jiang et al., 2007), resulting in enhanced proliferation and survival.However, CpG alone does not induce IgG or IgA class switching (He et al., 2004;Jiang et al., 2007).IL-2 supports human B cell proliferation and Ig production (Yoshizaki et al., 1982;Arpin et al., 1995).
SLE-DCs and IFN-DCs were equally effective at enhancing the proliferation of naive B cells (Fig. 2, A and B).They also equally supported the differentiation of PBs (Fig. 2,  A and C), as measured by up-regulation of CD38 and downregulation of CD20 expression.Although IFN-DCs and SLE-DCs were equally potent at inducing IgM secretion, SLE-DCs were more potent than IFN-DCs at inducing naive B cells to secrete switched isotypes, especially IgA (Fig. 2 D).This was further confirmed by intracellular Ig staining (Fig. 2 E).The lower capability of IFN-DCs to promote IgG and IgA was not caused by a defect in AID (activation-induced cytidine deaminase) expression, as AICDA expression levels were similar in B cells co-cultured with either type of DCs (Fig. 2 F).RT-PCR analysis of switch circle transcripts revealed that naive B cells co-cultured with either IFN-DCs or SLE-DCs had significantly increased levels of I-C (Fig. 2 G).Naive B cells co-cultured with SLE-DCs but not IFN-DCs showed increased levels of IgA class switching as measured by I-C transcripts.Additionally, B cells co-cultured with SLE-DCs showed higher levels of the mature transcripts V H DJ H -C H  3 and V H DJ H -C H  1 than B cells co-cultured with IFN-DCs (Fig. 2 H).Compared with B cells alone, IFN-DCs also increased expression of V H DJ H -C H  and V H DJ H -C H  3 transcripts.Collectively, SLE-DCs display a potent capability to enhance naive B cell differentiation into IgG-and IgA-PBs.Although SLE sera contain elevated levels of IL-21 (0.05-2 ng/ml; Kang et al., 2011), 1-100 ng/ml of exogenous IL-21 did not further enhance the SLE-DC-mediated naive B cell responses in the presence of IL-2 and CpG (not depicted).

SLE-DCs enhance IgG and IgA secretion from memory B cells and support PB survival

We then tested whether SLE-DCs could promote the differentiation of both CD19 + IgD + CD27 + and CD19 + IgD  CD27 + memory B cells into PBs.As shown in Fig. 3 A, SLE-DCs efficiently induced IgD + CD27 + B cell differentiation into PBs (CD20  CD38 + ) secreting IgG and IgA.In particular, SLE-DCs were more efficient than IFN-DCs at inducing or TACI-Fc did not significantly decrease SLE-DC-mediated B cell proliferation (Fig. S1 B) but decreased the total number of B cells acquired at the end of cultures (Fig. S1 C).
Along with BAFF and APRIL, DCs can secrete other cytokines providing B cell help, such as IL-10 and IL-6.
Supernatants from co-cultures of naive B cells with the two types of DCs contained similar levels of IL-10 (Fig. 4 C).To access the sources of IL-10 in the co-culture, cells were stained for intracellular cytokine expression.picted).Blocking IL-6 with anti-IL-6 and IL-6R antibodies did not significantly alter IgG responses.This might be because of the fact that anti-IL-6/IL-6R cannot efficiently block intracellularly expressed IL-6 that is used by B cells (Burdin et al., 1995).
To further explore the roles of BAFF and IL-10 in naive B cell responses, BCR-activated naive B cells were cultured with combinations of exogenous IL-10 and BAFF in the presence of IL-2 and CpG.In the presence of 20 ng/ml IL-10, BAFF did not show significant effects on naive B cell differentiation into PBs (Fig. 5 A), but the numbers of B cells acquired on day 6 were slightly increased by the increasing However, a majority of the two types of DCs co-cultured for 24 h with naive B cells expressed IL-10 but not IL-6 (Fig. 4 E  This supports the important roles of APRIL without or with BAFF in the enhanced IgM and IgA responses, which were mediated by SLE-DCs.

SLE-DCs trans-present CD138-bound APRIL to B cells to enhance IgA responses

Although SLE-DCs express APRIL (Fig. 4 A), the amount of soluble APRIL is small compared with what is found in SLE serum (Cheema et al., 2001;Koyama et al., 2005).This led us to consider that APRIL might remain cell bound.Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs; Hendriks et al., 2005;Ingold et al., 2005;Moreaux et al., 2009), such as syndecan-1 (CD138), are expressed on PCs and bind APRIL.Indeed, we found that SLE-DCs but not IFN-DCs express CD138 (Fig. 6 A, top) as well as membrane-bound APRIL (Fig. 6 A, bottom).amounts of BAFF added to the cultures.This suggests that BAFF can support B cell survival (Stohl et al., 2003;Schneider, 2005).In contrast to BAFF, IL-10 was able to enhance PB differentiation in a dose-dependent manner.Consequently, the amounts of Igs secreted from B cells were mainly dependent on IL-10 added to the culture (Fig. 5 A  (Fig. 6 A).Thus, we conclude that SLE serum induces CD138 expression on SLE-DCs in an IFN-independent manner.This may allow SLE-DCs to trans-present APRIL to promote B cell responses in SLE.
To test whether such membrane-bound APRIL is functional, SLE-DCs were exposed to exogenous APRIL for 30 min, washed out, and co-cultured with naive B cells in the presence of IL-2 and CpG.APRIL-fed SLE-DCs resulted in enhanced naive B cell proliferation (Fig. 6 F, left and top right) and PB differentiation (Fig. 6 F, left and bottom right).In addition, APRIL-fed SLE-DCs displayed an enhanced ability to induce IgA but not IgG or IgM secretion by activated naive B cells (Fig. 6 G).These findings were further established by blocking membrane-bound APRIL with TACI-Fc (Fig. 6, H and I).APRIL-fed DCs were incubated with TACI-Fc for 30 min and washed to remove unbound TACI-Fc before they were co-cultured with naive Accordingly, SLE-DCs but not IFN-DCs could efficiently capture and display exogenous APRIL on their surface in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6 B).This binding is specific, as preincubation of APRIL with HSPGs diminished the binding of APRIL to the surface of DCs (Fig. 6 C, bottom).IFN-DCs did not express significant levels of surface CD138 (Fig. 6 A), and thus the preincubation of APRIL with HSPGs did not alter the surface APRIL expression (Fig. 6 C, top).Furthermore, treatment of SLE-DCs with anti-CD138 antibody but not with an isotype control antibody resulted in decreased binding of exogenous APRIL to the surface of SLE-DCs (Fig. 6 D).Consequently, preincubation of APRIL with soluble CD138 resulted in decreased binding of exogenous APRIL to these cells (Fig. 6 E).More than 10 µg/ml of soluble CD138 did not further enhance the inhibition of APRIL binding to the cells.IFN- did not induce CD138 expression on monocytes, as IFN-DCs do not express CD138

SLE monocytes express CD138 and trans-present membrane-bound APRIL to promote IgA responses

Subsets of monocytes (G1, CD14 high CD16  ; G2, CD-14 high CD16 low ; and G3, CD14 low CD16 high ; Fig. 8 D, top) from SLE patients and healthy controls were stained for the surface expression of CD138 and APRIL.None of the three subsets of monocytes from healthy donors expressed either of these molecules on their surface (Fig. 8 D, bottom left).In contrast, monocytes from SLE patients showed three different patterns of surface CD138 and APRIL expression (Fig. 8 D, bottom right three panels): only a fraction of monocytes (I), all populations of monocytes (II), and none (III).More importantly, we found that the percentage of APRIL + monocytes correlates with disease activity as measured by the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI; Fig. 8 E).Furthermore, monocytes were able to induce naive B cells to isotype switch and to secrete Igs.Blocking membrane-bound APRIL with TACI-Fc significantly decreased IgM and IgA responses (Fig. 8 F).Blocking IL-10 also decreased IgG responses.We were also able to detect both CD138 and APRIL expression on the surface of myeloid DCs in the blood of SLE patients (not depicted).However, the numbers of DCs in the small volumes (10-15 ml) of blood from pediatric patients did not allow us to test their functions.Collectively, our data demonstrate that SLE patient blood monocytes express CD138 and surface APRIL and promote IgM-and IgA-B cell responses.These cells also enhance IgG-secreting responses through the production of IL-10.

DISCUSSION

Autoantibodies are a hallmark of SLE, and B cells remain one of the main therapeutic targets in this disease.Our study demonstrated for the first time that SLE serum induces healthy monocyte differentiation into DCs with a unique ability to promote B cell responses.In particular, SLE-DCs and monocytes from the blood of SLE patients could efficiently generate antibody-secreting PBs, reminiscent of those found in the B cells.TACI-Fc decreased the proliferation of naive B cells (Fig. 6 H, left) without significantly affecting PB differentiation (Fig. 6 H, right).However, TACI-Fc decreased both IgM and IgA responses without affecting IgG (Fig. 6

I).

Transwell experiments further confirmed the importance of cell-cell contact for SLE-DC-mediated IgM and IgA secretion but not for IgG secretion (Fig. 7 A).Addition of soluble APRIL directly to activated naive B cells resulted in modestly increased proliferation and PB differentiation (Fig. 7 B).It also increased IgM and IgG secretion, without affecting that of IgA (Fig. 7 B).Collectively, our data demonstrates that trans-presentation of APRIL through CD138 is critical for SLE-DCs to promote IgM and particularly IgA responses.

SLE patients exhibit high numbers of IgG-and IgA-PBs in blood

To assess the in vivo relevance of our findings, we characterized the mature B cell and PB compartments in the blood of SLE patients and healthy controls.The presence of expanded PC precursors in the blood of pediatric and adult SLE patients (Odendahl et al., 2000;Arce et al., 2001) and elevated serum IgA and IgG levels in SLE patients have been described earlier (Conley and Koopman, 1983;Lin and Li, 2009).As shown in Fig. 8 A, SLE patients displayed expanded CD19 low CD20  CD38 + PBs in their blood compared with healthy individuals.This expansion of PBs was accounted for by isotype-switched PBs (Fig. 8, B and C).Healthy individuals displayed IgG + and IgA + B cells, but most of the isotype-switched B cells were CD20 + (Fig. 8 B).In contrast, SLE patients displayed significant numbers of CD20  IgG + and CD20  IgA + PBs in their blood.Experiments performed with multiple donors are summarized in Fig. 8 C. The percentage of IgM + PBs in patients was low (<1% of total CD19 + B cells).Thus, SLE patients show increased numbers of circulating IgG + and IgA + PB.CCR5, but low numbers of IFN-DCs (<10%) express the two surface molecules.CCR5 is known to be important in disease progression in lupus nephropathy as well as in other glomerular diseases and can be found elevated on the surface of DCs in autoimmune disorders (Furuichi et al., 2000;Stasikowska et al., 2007).It is also expressed on CD14 + CD16 + human monocytes, which have been described in the renal interstitium of SLE patients (Furuichi et al., 2000;Stasikowska et al., 2007).blood of SLE patients.Thus, SLE serum represents a unique microenvironment for the generation of DCs that could play a role in SLE pathogenesis through interactions with B cells.
IFN- is a key player contributing to the differentiation of SLE serum-exposed monocytes into DCs (Blanco et al., 2001).However, DCs generated with IFN-, IFN-DCs, were phenotypically and functionally distinct from SLE-DCs.For example, >50% of the SLE-DCs express CD163 and suffering certain clinical manifestations such as nephritis and/or display a unique disease course.
The contribution of BAFF to B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases is relatively well understood.Excessive BAFF expression leads to autoimmunity in mice (Mackay et al., 1999;Gross et al., 2000).Elevated levels of BAFF in SLE serum support autoreactive naive B cell (Stohl et al., 2003) and PC survival (Schneider, 2005), which is consistent with our data.Thus, blocking BAFF or BAFF/APRIL is a promising therapeutic approach to treat B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, and drugs that block BAFF or BAFF/APRIL have been recently approved to treat SLE (Dillon et al., 2006;Sanz and Lee, 2010), although modest clinical responses were observed in phase III clinical trials.However, PBs and PCs predominantly express BCMA and TACI that bind to both BAFF and APRIL.We show that the selective blockade of BAFF reduced only IgG, whereas nonselective blockers (TACI-Fc and BCMA-Fc) also decreased IgA secretion.
The information obtained from this study is particularly relevant to the generation of extrafollicular, T-independent B cell responses (Fagarasan and Honjo, 2000;Litinskiy et al., 2002;Crispín et al., 2010).Studying the role of SLE serum and SLE-DCs in T-dependent B cell responses is warranted, however, as the type of DC-B cell interaction that we herein describe could also be relevant to the expansion and survival of PBs and PCs from a pool of autoreactive memory B cells initially generated in the context of T cell help.It remains to be seen whether therapies, alone or in combination, aimed at blocking these interactions will find a place in the SLE armamentarium.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patients and sera.A total of 96 pediatric patients, who met the American College of Rheumatology Revised Criteria for SLE, were enrolled in this study (Table S1).Patients were recruited at the Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children (Dallas, TX) and Children's Medical Center of Dallas (Dallas, TX).Patients who received i.v.steroid, Mycophenolate, Methotrexate, >10 mg prednisone, and/or >200 mg Plaquenil were excluded.Disease activity was measured by the SLEDAI.36 healthy controls were recruited at the Baylor Institute for Immunology Research (Dallas, TX).The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Baylor Research Institute, and informed consent was obtained from all participants.Blood from patients was obtained during routine examinations.Patient sera were prepared with topical thrombin (King Pharmaceuticals).
Monocytes and B cells.PBMCs were isolated using Ficoll-Paque PLUS gradient (GE Healthcare).Monocytes were purified using the EasySep Human Monocyte Enrichment kit (negative selection; STEMCELL Technologies) to a purity >93%.Total B cells were purified using the EasySep Human B Cell Enrichment kit (negative selection; STEMCELL Technologies) to a purity >95%.Subsets of B cells were further sorted by FACSAria II or FACSVantage (BD) to yield the following populations: naive (CD19 + IgD + CD27  ), memory (CD19 + IgD  CD27 + ), marginal zonelike B cells (CD19 + IgD + CD27 + ), and PBs (CD19 low CD20  CD38 + ) to a purity >97%.
DCs. IFN-DCs and IL-4-DCs were generated by culturing healthy monocytes in serum-free CellGenix media (CellGenix GmbH) supplemented with 50 ng/ml GM-CSF (Baylor Hospital Pharmacy) and 250 U/ml IFN- Other studies have also shown elevated levels of the CCR5 ligands RANTES and MIP-1 in the kidneys and serum of SLE patients (Lit et al., 2006;Stasikowska et al., 2007;Vilá et al., 2007).CD163 is a scavenger receptor (Van Gorp et al., 2010) that might contribute to the removal of apoptotic cells.Whether CD163 expression plays a role in disease, such as favoring the presentation of apoptotic cell-derived antigens by SLE-DCs, needs to be further studied.
Although IFN-DCs and SLE-DCs were able to induce the proliferation of B cells and their differentiation into PBs, SLE-DCs were more efficient than IFN-DCs at inducing switched B cell responses, especially IgA-secreting B cell responses.The enhanced IgG responses by IFN-DCs and SLE-DCs were mainly dependent on IL-10 and IL-10/BAFF, respectively.The ability of SLE-DCs to induce IgA secretion was further linked to their surface expression of CD138, which enables the trans-presentation of APRIL to B cells.More importantly, SLE blood monocytes also expressed CD138 and trans-presented APRIL to B cells, resulting in the promotion of IgA responses.CD138 expressed on PCs has been described as an APRIL-binding partner, which is the prerequisite for the triggering of TACI-and/or BCMAmediated PC survival (Ingold et al., 2005).CD138-bound APRIL on the surface of PCs can create unique niches that support the accumulation of PCs in mucosal surfaces (Huard et al., 2008).We found that APRIL trans-presented by SLE-DCs was efficient at enhancing IgA-secreting B cell responses.Soluble APRIL directly added to B cells only resulted in IgM secretion, supporting the idea that trans-presentation of APRIL through CD138 is one of the key mechanisms responsible for SLE-DC-mediated IgA switching and PB differentiation.This is consistent with the requirement of SLE-DCs to be in direct contact with B cells for these effects to be observed.
Although the pathogenic role of SLE IgG autoantibodies is well described, the contribution of IgA to disease pathogenesis remains largely unknown.A previous study has described a profound increase of serum IgA level in lupus patients compared with controls (Conley and Koopman, 1983).Of interest, IgA from some patients has been reported to display a lower degree of glycosylation compared with controls, which has been linked to the pathogenic nature of this isotype in a related disease, IgA nephropathy (Donadio et al., 1978;Matei andMatei, 2000-2001).Furthermore, deposits of IgA are found in the kidneys of patients with SLE (Florquin et al., 2001).Although not currently used as an inclusion criteria for SLE, IgA autoantibodies, such as anticardiolipin and anti-2-glycoprotein-I, have been shown to predict disease manifestations such as pro-thrombotic events (Wilson et al., 1998;Kumar et al., 2009;Sweiss et al., 2010;Mehrani and Petri, 2011a,b).In addition, the lupus-prone B6.Sle1Sle3 mouse strain produces high levels of anti-nuclear IgA autoantibodies that are deposited in the kidney glomeruli and are implicated in the pathogenesis of nephritis (Liu et al., 2007).Although selective IgA deficiency does not preclude the development of SLE, there is not enough data to ascertain whether IgA-deficient SLE patients could be excluded from RT-PCR.Total RNA was isolated from B cells co-cultured with DCs using the RNAqueous Micro kit (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized using the Reverse Transcription System (Promega).cDNA was amplified with the LightCycler SYBR Green Master I kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions and run on a LightCycler 480 (Roche).Primers for switch circles, mature transcripts, AICDA, and -actin were as previously described (He et al., 2007;Dullaers et al., 2009); Bcl-X L forward, 5-AAGC-GCTCCTGGCCTTTC-3; Bcl-X L reverse, 5-CTGGGACACTTTTGT-GGATCTCT-3; Bcl-2 forward, 5-TGGGATGCCTTTGTGGAACT-3; and Bcl-2 reverse, 5-GAGACAGCCAGGAGAAATCAAAC-3.Relative expression was determined using the comparative C t method.
APRIL binding assays.DCs were incubated with a titrating dose of APRIL trimer (ZymoGenetics) for 30 min at 37°C.50 µg/ml HSPGs (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the DCs 30 min before the addition of APRIL.Membrane-bound APRIL was detected by anti-human APRIL antibody (Enzo Life Sciences).
Cytokine ELISA and intracellular staining.10 5 DCs were plated in a 100-µl volume and stimulated for 24 h with and without 20 ng/ml Escherichia coli LPS (InvivoGen).IL-10 was measured on a Luminex bead-based platform using a Bio Plex 200 and the Bio Plex Manager 5.0 software (Bio-Rad Laboratories).This system was also used to determine the concentration of IL-10 in DC-B cell co-culture systems.Both IFN-DCs and SLE-DCs were stained for intracellular IL-6 and IL-10 before co-culturing with B cells.In addition, DCs and naive B cells were co-cultured for 24 h and then stained for intracellular IL-6 and IL-10.

Statistical analysis.

Statistical significance was determined using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student's t test using Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software).Significance was set at P < 0.05.Online supplemental material.Fig. S1 shows that TACI-Fc and anti-BAFF antibody decrease IgM and IgA as well as IgG responses, respectively, in dose-dependent manners.Table S1 presents demographics of SLE patients and healthy donors tested in this study.Online supplemental material is available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20111644/DC1.Antibodies, reagents, and flow cytometry.For the DC phenotype the following were used: anti-CD163-FITC, anti-CD86-PE, anti-CCR5-PE, anti-BCMA, anti-IL-10-PacBlue, anti-IL-6-PE (R&D Systems), anti-CD138-PE, anti-CD1a-FITC, anti-CD80-PE (eBioscience), anti-CD14-PerCp, anti-CD16-APC-Cy7 and anti-CD83-APC (BioLegend), anti-CD138 polyclonal antibody (LSBiosciences), and soluble CD138 (R&D Systems).Purified anti-human APRIL (Enzo Life Sciences) and anti-BCMA antibodies (R&D Systems) were conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) Live/dead-aqua (Invitrogen).For the B cell phenotype the following were used: anti-CD38-PECy7 (BioLegend), anti-human IgG-PE, antihuman IgA-APC (Miltenyi Biotec), anti-CD20-PECy5, anti-CD27-APCCy7 (BD), CFSE, Live/dead-aqua (Invitrogen), and anti-CD138-PE (eBioscience).For B cell sorting, anti-human IgD-PE, anti-CD27-FITC (SouthernBiotech), anti-CD19-APC (BD), and anti-CD3-Quantum red (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-CD38-PECy7 (eBioscience), and BD Cytofix/ Cytoperm and BD Perm/Wash (BD) were used for intracellular staining as per the manufacturers' instructions.Cells were acquired on an LSRII or FACSCanto II (BD), and analysis was performed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
ELISA.Sandwich ELISAs were performed to measure total IgM, IgG, IgA, APRIL, and BAFF.Capture and detection antibodies for Ig ELISAs were purchased from SouthernBiotech.Human reference serum (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.) was used to generate the standard curve for Ig ELISAs.APRIL and BAFF ELISAs were performed using reagents provided by ZymoGenetics.All ELISAs used Nunc MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific).Plates were read with a SpectraMax M2 (Molecular Devices) and analyzed with SoftMaxPro V5 software (Molecular Devices).DC morphology.Cells were stained using the DiffQuick Stain Set (Siemens) as per the manufacturer's instructions and visualized on a microscope (BX60; Olympus) at 100× using a digital camera (DXM1200C; Nikon) and NIS Elements Software (Nikon).
Cell culture.4 × 10 4 purified B cells were co-cultured with 5 × 10 3 DCs in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with Hepes (Invitrogen), nonessential amino acids, l-glutamate (Sigma-Aldrich), Pen/strep and 10% FBS (HyClone; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 20 U/ml IL-2 (R&D Systems).50 nM CpG (ODN2006; InvivoGen) was added to the co-cultures of naive B cells and DCs.CpG was not added into the co-cultures of total or memory B cells and DCs. 10 µg/ml -BAFF antibody (R&D Systems), TACI-Fc, and BCMA-Fc (ZymoGenetics and R&D systems), and control IgG 1 (Sigma-Aldrich) were added into B cell/DC co-culture systems.In some experiments, DCs were preincubated with 2 µg/ml APRIL trimer (ZymoGenetics) for 30 min and then washed before their addition to the B cell co-culture.On day 6, B cells were stained for phenotype and intracellular Igs, and culture supernatants were harvested on day 12 for measuring secreted Igs.To generate PBs, purified total B cells were co-cultured with IL-4-DCs for 6 d.CD19 low CD38 + CD20  cells were sorted and used as PBs. 4 × 10 4 PBs were co-cultured with 5 × 10 3 DCs.For transwell experiments, 4 × 10 4 purified B cells were seeded in the lower compartment of a 96-well Nunc transwell insert, and 5 × 10 3 DCs were added to the upper portion.For some experiments, IL-10 and IL-10R were blocked using reagents from BD (clone JES3-9D7) and BioLegend (clone 3F9), respectively.
Naive B cells (10 6 /ml) were cultured with anti-IgM-coated beads (1 µg/ml; immunobeads rabbit anti-human IgM; Irvine Scientific).Cells were cultured with different concentrations of cytokines, IL-10 (PeproTech), and BAFF (ZymoGenetics) in the presence of 50 nM CpG and 20 U/ml IL-2.B cell proliferation and PB differentiation as well as Ig secretion were measured on day 6 and 12, respectively.

, left).Large fractions of B cells co-cultured with either IFN-DCs or SLE-DCs expressed IL-6 but not IL-10 (Fig. 4 E, right).Thus, IL-10 in the co-culture supernatants (Fig. 4 C) is mainly secreted from DCs.To test the roles of IL-10 in naive B cell responses induced by the two DC types, anti-IL-10 and anti-IL-10R antibodies were added to the co-culture of DCs and naive B cells in the presence of IL-2 and CpG.Neutralizing IL-10 decreased IgG level induced by both DC types (Fig. 4 F).Blocking IL-10 did not significantly alter IgM-or IgAsecreting B cell responses.Thus, SLE-DC-mediated enhanced IgG secretion is largely dependent on both BAFF (Fig. 4 B) and IL-10 (Fig. 4 F), whereas secretion of IgM and IgA mainly depends on APRIL with or without BAFF (Fig. 4 B).Blocking BAFF did not significantly alter the

). IL-10 and BAFF did not show any synergistic effects on PB differentiation.Although IL-10 also enhanced IgM and IgA secretion from BCR-activated naive B cells (Fig. 5 B), blocking IL-10 in the co-culture of naive B cells and SLE-DCs resulted in only slightly decreased levels of IgM and IgA (Fig. 4 F).

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Multiple factors orchestrate the inflammatory response to tissue injury. These include proteases, antiproteases, cytokines, chemokines, and the growth factors derived from the plasma and cells associated with the injury, as well as from cells invading the injury site (1). Emigrating polymorphonuclear leukocytes release proteolytic enzymes into the injury site, including the most potent serine proteases, neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G (CatG). 1 These enzymes aid wound repair by digesting extracellular proteins, releasing growth factors from extracellular matrix, and remodeling the tissue (2)(3)(4). However, these enzymes can also destroy tissues when proteolysis is prolonged, inappropriate, or excessive (5,6).
Enormous local concentrations of proteases, estimated to be in the millimolar range for elastase and cathepsin G, are released into extracellular spaces during the leukocyte activation associated with tissue injury (7). Serine protease inhibitors (serpins), provide efficient control mechanisms to prevent undesirable extracellular protein degradation at the injury site (8). These antiproteases, mostly derived from plasma, share three principal properties: (i) they form 1:1 covalent complex with proteases, (ii) complex formation results in both inactivation of the protease and proteolytic cleavage of the serpin, and (iii) inhibition is essentially irreversible (9). The balance of proteases and antiproteases at the site of injury can regulate the extent of the inflammatory response during the repair process (10,11).
Dermal wound repair requires harmonious protease-antiprotease interactions or proteolytic balance. Excessive elastase action in the wound bed can account for endothelial damage (12), degradation of the epidermal/dermal junction (13), and the development of chronic skin ulcers (14). Physiological neutrophil elastase inhibitors include plasma-derived ␣ 2 -macroglobulin and, most importantly, ␣ 1 -proteinase inhibitor (also known as ␣ 1 -PI, ␣ 1 -antitrypsin, or ␣ 1 -AT). The importance of ␣ 1 -PI in regulating the response to tissue injury is emphasized by the extensive elastin and collagen fiber destruction leading to pulmonary emphysema in the lungs of individuals with congenital ␣ 1 -PI deficiency (5). The major physiological cathepsin G inhibitor is ␣ 1 -antichymotrypsin (␣ 1 -Achy), another plasma-derived serpin (15). Inherited ␣ 1 -Achy deficiency is pleiomorphic, but it is often associated with chronic active hepatitis and increased residual lung volumes (16). Another serpin that inhibits cathepsin G is the squamous cell carcinoma antigen 2 (SCCA2), a newly described product of skin and respiratory tract epithelia (17).
Although the activity of one class of serpins is accelerated by binding to heparin or other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (9,18), ␣ 1 -PI and ␣ 1 -Achy belong to the class of serpins that function independently of heparin and other GAGs. However, heparin can bind with high affinity to both neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G (19,20). This binding inhibits the enzymatic activities, but most importantly, it reduces the ability of the enzymes to interact with serpins (19,20). The heparin used clinically and in these studies is a pharmaceutical product derived from processing of the heparin proteoglycan within mast cells (21). The major physiological source of the heparin-like GAG, heparan sulfate, is found in proteoglycans within cells, at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix (22).
Most cellular heparan sulfate derives from the syndecan family of cell surface proteoglycans. This family (currently known as syndecan 1-4 in mammals) consists of single transmembrane proteins containing conserved cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains and less well conserved extracellular domains (ectodomains), which bear variable numbers of GAG chains. All syndecans bear heparan sulfate, although syndecan-1 and -3 can also bear chondroitin sulfate. Syndecans bind many of the factors that orchestrate the inflammatory response to tissue injury as well as a variety of extracellular matrix components and adhesion molecules via their heparan sulfate chains and are individually expressed in distinct cell-, tissue-, and development-specific patterns (23).
Syndecan expression is highly regulated during wound repair. During cutaneous wound repair, keratinocytes migrating from the wound edge show loss of cell surface syndecan-1 (24). Concomitantly, syndecan-1 expression increases on the endothelial cells, and syndecan-4 expression increases on the dermal fibroblasts that form the granulation tissue (24,25), apparently due to inductive action of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides (26). Syndecans on cell surfaces can be cleaved near the plasma membrane, which releases the now soluble intact proteoglycan ectodomains into the surrounding milieu (27). This shedding is accelerated by activation of protease (e.g. thrombin) and growth factor receptors (epidermal growth factor family members) and by the direct action of proteases (e.g. plasmin) involved in wound repair (27). Moreover, soluble syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains are detected in acute dermal wound fluids (27). Although syndecan expression and shedding are highly regulated during the response to tissue injury, the role these processes play in this response is not clear.
A key aspect of the response to tissue injury is the establishment and maintenance of proteolytic balance at the wound site. The action of the major proteases, neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G, must be countered by their major inhibitors, ␣ 1 -PI and ␣ 1 -Achy, for normal wound repair to ensue. Loss of this balance can prevent normal repair, potentially leading to chronic wounds, which in the skin are difficult to treat satisfactorily (14). We postulated that because activities of the major proteases in acute wound fluids can be modified in vitro by heparin, soluble syndecan ectodomains could be involved in establishing and maintaining the proteolytic balance in wounds in vivo. We found syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains in acute human dermal wound fluids. We also found that purified syndecan-1 ectodomain binds to both neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G, markedly reducing their affinity for serpins and thus protecting these enzymes from their physiological inhibitors. Moreover, both degradation of endogenous heparan sulfate and removal of syndecan-1 and -4 from wound fluids reduce proteolytic activities in the fluid. Thus, syndecan ectodomains maintain the proteolytic balance in acute wound fluids, a novel physiological role for soluble heparan sulfate proteoglycans.
Materials-Flat bottomed, low binding 96-well microtiter plates were obtained from Costar (Cambridge, MA). Human trypsin and mouse IgG were from Sigma, human neutrophil cathepsin G and human plasma ␣ 1 -PI were from Athens Research & Technology Inc. (Athens, GA), human neutrophil elastase was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), and human plasma ␣ 1 -Achy was from Biodesign International (Kennebunk, ME). Purified glutathione S-transferase-SCCA2 fusion protein was a kind gift from Dr. Gary Silverman, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA (17). For enzyme substrates, succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-para-nitroanilide (Suc-AAPF-pNA) for cathepsin G and N-benzoyl-Phe-Val-Arg-pNA for trypsin were from Sigma, and (benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ)-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala) 2 MD). The syndecan-1 ectodomain was purified to homogeneity from the conditioned medium of NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial cells (28). One mg of this syndecan-1 core protein contains 5 mg of HS. 2 cDNA for ectodomains of human syndecan-1 and -4 in glutathione S-transferase expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were expressed as fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, induced by 0.2 mM isopropyl-1thio-␤-D-galactopyranoside for 6 h at 37°C, solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged 12,000 ϫ g for 10 min. Supernatants were purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma); washed with PBS; eluted with 50 mM Tris, pH 8, and 5 mM reduced glutathione (Janssen Chimica, New Brunswick, NJ); subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and detected with Coomassie Blue. Antibodies used were polyclonal antisera HSE-1 against the recombinant human syndecan-1 ectodomain (25); monoclonal antibodies MCA-681 from Serotec (Oxford, United Kingdom) and DL-101 against human syndecan-1, 5G9 and 8C7 (25) against human syndecan-4, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. (West Grove, PA).
For production of monoclonal antibodies specific to human syndecan-1, recombinant syndecan-1 was used for immunization of mice, and production of monoclonal antibody was by Maine Biotechnology Services, Inc. (Portland, ME). Mice were immunized and boosted with 100 g of recombinant syndecan-1. Out of 12 hybridoma clones, which produced antibodies reacting with human syndecan-1 fusion protein, only 1 (DL-101) reacted specifically with native human syndecan-1 ectodomain purified from conditioned media of human A431 cells. This was assessed as reactivity on Western blotting with a 300-kDa proteoglycan smear, which reduced to a 70-kDa core protein after treatment with heparitinase and chondroitinase ABC as described previously (30).
Affinity Co-electrophoresis (ACE) Analyses-NMuMG cells were labeled with radiosulfate, and [ 35 S]sulfate-labeled syndecan-1 ectodomain from conditioned medium was purified by DEAE and immunoaffinity chromatography (28). Binding of this ectodomain to elastase and cathepsin G was assessed by ACE as described elsewhere (31,32). Briefly, 1% (w/v) low melt agarose gels were cast containing distinct lanes with various concentrations of protease (indicated in Fig. 1). [ 35 S]Sulfate-labeled syndecan-1 ectodomain (12,500 cpm) was electrophoresed through these lanes. In competition assays, the same amount of syndecan-1 was mixed with 1 mg/ml chondroitin-6 sulfate or heparin prior to electrophoresis. The migration on syndecan-1 was detected on a PhosphoImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The pixel intensities were integrated and used to determine the migration distance of the major peak of 35 S-labeled syndecan-1 in each proteasecontaining lane. These mobilities were plotted as a function of ligand concentration and used to estimate the apparent K d values as described earlier (32).
Assays for Enzyme Inhibition-The amounts of proteases and serpins were calibrated by the method of Chase and Shaw (33). Trypsin was calibrated by using p-nitrophenyl-pЈ-guanidinobenzoate (Sigma), except that 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, was used in place of sodium barbiturate buffer. The concentration of ␣ 1 -PI was standardized against calibrated trypsin. Elastase and cathepsin G were calibrated against the standardized ␣ 1 -PI. ␣ 1 -Achy was calibrated against the standardized cathepsin G. Reaction buffers were 50 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 5% N,N-dimethylformamide, pH 7.4, for cathepsin G, and 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, for elastase.
Enzyme inhibition was determined by mixing enzyme with increasing concentrations of syndecan-1 in the appropriate reaction buffer and incubating for 15 min at 25°C. The inhibitor was added, and residual enzyme activity was determined by adding the appropriate substrate and measuring hydrolysis at 405 nm with a UVmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices) or at 488 nm with a FluorImager 575 (Molecular Dynamics). The concentrations for cathepsin G assays were 34 nM cathepsin G, 34 nM ␣ 1 -Achy or SCCA2, and 3 mM Suc-AAPF-pNA. The concentrations for elastase assays were 34 nM elastase, 34 nM ␣ 1 -PI, and 5 M (CBZ-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala) 2 -R110. In some experiments, syndecan-1 (up to 7.5 g as HS) was pretreated with heparinase (150 milliunits/ml), heparitinase (150 milliunits/ml each) or chondroitinase ABC (1.0 units/ ml) in 10 l of 50 mM Tris, 10 mM NaAc, pH 7.4, for 6 h at 37°C and boiled for 10 min.
Protease-Serpin Binding Stoichiometry-Constant concentrations of syndecan-1 ectodomain or heparin were preincubated with protease for 15 min at 25°C with increasing concentrations of serpin in the appropriate reaction buffer, and the residual enzyme activities were measured with an appropriate substrate. The concentrations for cathepsin G assays were 34 nM cathepsin G and 3 mM Suc-AAPF-pNA in cathepsin G reaction buffer. The concentrations for elastase assays were 34 nM elastase and 5 M (CBZ-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala) 2 -R110 in elastase reaction buffer.
Determination of Rate Constant k ass for Enzyme-Inhibitor Association-The association rate constant for the interaction of serpins with free and syndecan-1-bound enzymes was determined under second order rate conditions (15). Equimolar amounts (34 nM) of enzyme with or without the syndecan-1 ectodomain and inhibitor were incubated at 25°C for varying periods of time. The reaction was quenched by the addition of substrate, for which the enzyme has higher affinity, and the release of pNA or rhodamine was measured. The residual enzyme activities were used to calculate the concentration of free enzyme E. Protease standard curves used for calculation of free enzyme were done in the presence and absence of syndecan-1 ectodomain. The rate of change in the amount of free enzyme over time is described as
where the slope of the plot of reciprocal remaining free enzyme (1/E) over time (t) yields a second order rate constant (k ass ).
Collection of Acute Wound Fluids-Acute human dermal wound fluids were collected from reduction mammoplasty patients (samples were kindly provided by Dr. E. Eriksson, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). Wound fluids were collected at 1-day intervals from sterile closed-suction drains routinely placed in the subcutaneous space after mammoplasty. After collection, fluids were centrifuged for 15 min at 200 ϫ g and 4°C to remove cells and further for 15 min at 3300 ϫ g and 4°C to remove debris. The supernatants were stored at Ϫ70°C until use. Porcine wound fluid was produced, collected, and processed as described previously (26,34).
Informed consent was obtained for all procedures, and the use of anonymous discarded material was approved by the Human Research Committee (protocol 95-7509-01, Brigham and Women's Hospital).
Immunodetections-Acute wound fluids collected from several patients were blotted on Immobilon-N membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a Dot Blot apparatus. Membranes were blocked for 60 min with 3% nonfat dry milk, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 3% H 2 O 2 , 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and incubated for 60 min with polyclonal antisera HSE-1 for syndecan-1 and monoclonal antibody 5G9 for syndecan-4, followed by a 60-min incubation with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-rabbit IgG or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antimouse IgG, respectively. Syndecans were detected by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
Assays for Enzyme Activities in Wound Fluids-Day 1 human wound fluids were treated with 150 milliunits/ml heparinase (Hase) and heparitinase (HSase) for 3 h at 37°C in 50 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, to degrade endogenous heparan sulfate in the fluid. Five min after adding heparin (up to 5 g/ml) to untreated or Hase/HSase-treated fluids, the chymotryptic and elastolytic activities in the samples were detected by adding the appropriate substrate (3 mM Suc-AAPF-pNA for chymotryptic and 5 M (CBZ-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala) 2 -R110 for elastolytic activities). Hydrolysis was measured over time at 405 nm with a UVmax plate reader (Molecular Devices) or at 488 nm with a FluorImager 575 (Molecular Dynamics).
Immunodepletion of Syndecan-1 and -4 Ectodomains from Wound Fluid-Acute human dermal wound fluids precleared by centrifugation (0.5 ml) were sequentially incubated (at 4°C for 30 min each) with a mixture of 20 g/ml of each monoclonal antibody to syndecan-1 (DL101 and MCA-681) and syndecan-4 (5G9 and 8C7) or with 80 g/ml of mouse IgG, 80 g/ml rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA), and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Beads were centrifuged, and supernatants were assayed for elastolytic activity in elastase reaction buffer by adding 5 M (CBZ-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala) 2 -R110 elastase substrate and measuring hydrolysis with time at 488 nm with a FluorImager 575 (Molecular Dynamics).

RESULTS


Syndecan-1 Ectodomain Binds Elastase and Cathepsin

G-Because heparin can protect elastase and cathepsin G against inhibition by certain plasma-derived serpins (19,20), we speculated that the soluble syndecan ectodomains in wound fluid might act similarly. [ 35 S]Sulfate-labeled syndecan-1 ectodomain purified from the conditioned media of NMuMG cells was incubated with nitrocellulose filters containing dots of purified human neutrophil cathepsin G and elastase, and serum-derived ␣ 1 -PI and ␣ 1 -Achy. The syndecan-1 ectodomain bound to cathepsin G and elastase at picomolar levels of protease, whereas no binding to the antiproteases was detected at 10-fold higher concentrations (data not shown). ACE (32) of [ 35 S]sulfate-labeled syndecan-1 ectodomain with cathepsin G and elastase confirmed this binding and yielded apparent K d values of 56 nM for cathepsin G and 35 nM for elastase (Fig. 1,  A and C). Heparin (1 mg/ml) completely abolished binding to the proteases, whereas chondroitin sulfate (1 mg/ml) had little or no effect, indicating that the binding is mainly due to the heparan sulfate chains on syndecan-1 (Fig. 1, B and D). The ACE profiles with both enzymes showed heterogeneity in syndecan-1 ectodomain binding at concentrations near the K d values (80 nM), suggesting that there are subfractions of the ectodomain that differ in their avidity for the proteases (data not shown).
Binding of Syndecan-1 Ectodomain to the Protease Reduces the Effect of Antiprotease-To determine whether the binding of the syndecan-1 ectodomain to the proteases affects their rate of interaction with a serpin, rate constants (k ass ) for these interactions were measured in the presence and absence of soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain (Table I). The protease and serpin form a 1:1 complex. Because neither heparin or the syndecan-1 ectodomain alters this stoichiometry (Fig. 2), the k ass were determined under second order conditions (15). Equimolar amounts (34 nM) of protease and serpin were incubated in the presence or absence of the syndecan-1 ectodomain at concentrations indicated in Table I. After various times, complex formation was quenched by adding substrate, and the remaining free enzyme activity was measured as described under "Experimental Procedures." The k ass for the interaction was calculated from linear regressions (Equation 1). The k ass for cathepsin G with ␣ 1 -antichymotrypsin decreased over 3700fold and with SCCA2 over 32-fold in the presence of the syndecan-1 ectodomain (Table I). The k ass for elastase with ␣ 1proteinase inhibitor was decreased 60-fold by the syndecan-1 ectodomain (Table I). For comparison, second order rate constants were also measured for protease-serpin complex formation in the presence of a heparin concentration equivalent to that of the syndecan-1 ectodomain HS (Table I). At the concentrations tested, the soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain decreased the rates of protease-serpin association at least as effectively as authentic heparin. The association rate for cathepsin G and ␣ 1 -antichymotrypsin was reduced to a significantly greater extent in the presence of soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain than in the presence of equivalent heparin concentration (Table I).
Soluble Syndecan-1 Ectodomain Modifies Protease Activities via Interactions of its Heparan Sulfate Chains-The effect of the purified syndecan-1 ectodomain on protease activity was assessed in the presence and absence of serpin. The ectodomain was preincubated with cathepsin G or elastase for 15 min and assayed for protease activity with or without equimolar concentrations of serpins (Fig. 3). Syndecan-1 ectodomain alone reduced cathepsin G activity in a concentration-dependent manner, reaching maximal inhibition (35%) at 2 g/ml as core protein (Fig. 3A). However, the syndecan-1 ectodomain markedly decreased the ability of both ␣ 1 -Achy and SCCA2 to inhibit cathepsin G activity (Fig. 3A). In the absence of ectodomain, these serpins completely inhibit the protease, but with increasing concentrations of ectodomain, their inhibitory activity is reduced and ultimately abolished (Fig. 3A). The syndecan-1 ectodomain was more effective in reducing cathepsin G inhibi-tion by SCCA2 (ED 50 ϭ 0.2 g/ml; Fig. 3A) than by ␣ 1 -Achy (ED 50 ϭ 0.5 g/ml; Fig. 3A). Analogous findings were obtained with elastase (Fig. 3B). The ectodomain alone reduced elastase activity, reaching maximal inhibition of approximately 40%. But the ectodomain also decreased the ability of ␣ 1 -PI to inhibit the protease (ED 50 ϭ 1.0 g/ml; Fig. 3B). These results indicate that syndecan-1 ectodomain alone reduces the activities of cathepsin G and elastase to an extent nearly identical to that observed with heparin (19,20). Moreover, binding of the syn-   decan-1 ectodomain to the proteases protects them from inhibition by serpins (Fig. 3).
To assess which GAG chains on the syndecan-1 ectodomain are responsible for its ability to protect the proteases from the antiproteases, syndecan-1 was pretreated with Hase (degrades heparin-like regions of HS chains), HSase (degrades low sulfated regions of HS chains), both Hase and HSase, or chondroitinase ABC (degrades chondroitin sulfate chains). Protease was preincubated for 15 min at 25°C with or without ectodomain that was untreated or had been pretreated with each of these enzymes and then mixed with antiprotease, and the residual enzyme activity was measured by adding the appropriate substrate. Hase and HSase preparations had no detectable elastase or cathepsin G activity, nor did they directly affect the activity of these proteases in test reactions. Progress curves show that Hase treatment alone reduced by about 30% and treatment with both Hase and HSase reduced by about 60% the ability of syndecan-1 to protect cathepsin G against antiproteases ␣ 1 -Achy and SCCA2 (Fig. 4, A and B), whereas chondroitinase ABC digestion had no effect (not shown). However, digestion of syndecan-1 HS chains with either Hase or HSase alone abolished the ability of syndecan-1 to protect elastase from inhibition by ␣ 1 -PI (Fig. 4C). Again, chondroitinase ABC digestion had no or little effect (data not shown). Heparan sulfate chains isolated from syndecan-1 and chondroitin sulfate-free syndecan-1 ectodomain were equally effective in protecting the proteases from inhibition by antiproteases (data not shown). Thus, the soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain protects cathepsin G and elastase against antiproteases via its heparan sulfate chains.
Soluble Syndecan-1 and -4 Ectodomains Can Alter the Proteolytic Balance of Wound Fluids-Wound fluids accumulating during dermal wound repair contain syndecan-1 and -4. Aliquots of cell-free human acute dermal wound fluids, collected days 1-3 after mammoplasty, were applied to cationic membranes. Antiserum to human syndecan-1 (HSE-1) and monoclonal antibody to human syndecan-4 (5G9) detected syndecan-1 and -4, respectively (Fig. 5). However, antibodies against the cytoplasmic domains of syndecan-1 and -4 failed to detect these proteoglycans (data not shown) (27), and neither proteoglycan was detected in human plasma (data not shown) (27).
We then asked whether these syndecan ectodomains could modify the balance between the endogenous proteases and their inhibitors in the wound fluid. To demonstrate this balance, we added heparin to wound fluids before and after de-grading the endogenous heparan sulfate in the fluid. Direct addition of as little as 2 g/ml heparin increased elastolytic activity, suggesting that heparin shifts the balance in favor of the protease (Fig. 6A). Degrading the endogenous heparan sulfate with the Hase/HSase mixture, as in Fig. 4, markedly reduced elastolytic activity (Fig. 6B). This enzymatic degradation similarly affected chymotryptic activity in pig wound fluids (data not shown). Adding heparin to the enzyme-treated sample shifted the balance in favor of the protease and nearly reversed the loss of activity (Fig. 6B). Thus, the activity of proteases and their inhibitors is balanced in wound fluid, and this balance can be shifted by the endogenous heparan sulfate in the fluid. To evaluate whether the syndecan ectodomains comprised the active heparan sulfate in the fluid, wound fluids were treated with monoclonal antibodies against the syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains or, as a control, with equal concentrations of mouse IgG, and the elastolytic activity was measured. Removal of syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains from each of 5 wound fluids reduced elastolytic activity 33-60% (Fig. 7). Adding heparin to immunodepleted samples shifted the balance in favor of the proteases and nearly reversed the loss of activity, identical to that observed in Fig. 6B (data not shown). These data indicate that soluble syndecan ectodomains maintain the proteolytic balance of wound fluids but do not complex with all the protease in the fluid. DISCUSSION In this study, we provide new insights into the regulation of protease-antiprotease balance during tissue injury. We show that syndecan-1 and -4, cell surface heparan sulfate proteogly- cans, are shed into wound fluids as soluble ectodomains. These acute dermal wound fluids contain the neutrophil-derived proteases cathepsin G and elastase, as well as the plasma-derived antiproteases ␣ 1 -PI and ␣ 1 -Achy. Both degradation of endogenous HS in the wound fluid and immunodepletion of syndecan-1 and -4 from the wound fluids alter the protease-antiprotease balance of the fluid. In vitro studies show that this balance results from binding of the HS chains on the ectodomains to cathepsin G and elastase. This interaction reduces the ability of the antiprotease to inhibit protease activity. These results indicate that syndecan-1 and -4 are shed into inflammatory fluids, where they modify the proteolytic balance of the fluids. The findings also suggest a novel physiological role for soluble heparan sulfate proteoglycans and new approaches to modulate the protease balance of inflammatory fluids.
Soluble Syndecan Ectodomains as Heparin-like Mediators at the Wound Site-Wound repair requires precise temporal and spatial regulation of a panoply of effectors, including chemo-kines, growth factors, extracellular components, cell adhesion proteins, proteases, and antiproteases. Many of these proteins bind heparin and heparan sulfate under physiological conditions and with high affinities (35). During repair of skin injury, cellular expression of syndecan-1 and -4 is altered (24,25), and cell surface syndecan-1 and -4 are converted to soluble molecules by juxtamembrane cleavage of their extracellular domains (ectodomains), a process known as shedding (27). Recent studies have shown that syndecan shedding is a highly regulated process that is stimulated by certain agents released at the site of tissue injury (27). Shedding instantly converts a cell surface proteoglycan into a soluble effector.
The functions of these soluble ectodomains are not clear. Syndecans on cell surfaces can act as co-receptors for heparinbinding growth factors; notably, the action of FGF-2 requires a growth factor-heparan sulfate proteoglycan-FGFR1 complex (36). However, because the soluble ectodomains retain all their HS, they can bind the same ligands as the cell surface syndecans, enabling them to be potential inhibitors of these ligand interactions. On the other hand, the soluble ectodomains place HS chains containing heparin-like domains into the wound environment. These chains can interact with heparin-binding proteins and peptides involved in the repair.
The inflammatory phase of tissue repair is characterized by plasma exudation and the involvement of neutrophils that produce and secrete the matrix remodeling enzymes elastase and cathepsin G. Although heparin binds and accelerates activity of some serpins (9), heparin does not interact with the serpins that regulate these enzymes. Rather, the enzymes themselves bind heparin, which reduces their affinity for the serpin and protects them from inhibition (19,20).
Our results indicate that the HS chains on the soluble syndecan ectodomains mimic this action of heparin and thus regulate the activity of the neutrophil-derived proteases in the wound environment (Fig. 4). Indeed, the syndecan-1 ectodomain HS chains are at least as effective in decreasing the protease-antiprotease interaction as an equal concentration of heparin (Table I). The binding affinities of the syndecan-1 ectodomain for the protease approximate that for heparin ( Fig.  1). As previously observed with heparin (19,20), the interaction between the syndecan-1 ectodomain and free protease inhibits the protease activity ( Fig. 3) but does not alter the stoichiometry of protease binding to the serpin (Fig. 2).
Proteolytic Balance in Wound Repair-Proteolysis is important for fibrinolysis, growth factor mobilization and activation, cell migration into the wound site, reepithelialization, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix degradation (37). An imbalance of proteolytic activity disrupts normal wound repair and capillary morphogenesis (38,39). If the soluble ectodomains also act like heparin to accelerate the activity of heparin-activatable serpins (viz. antithrombin III, protease nexin I, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and others), the ectodomain could regulate several aspects of proteolysis during wound repair.
Proteases in wounds co-exist with their physiological inhibitors, and thus their activity is finely regulated to provide optimal activity for repair. This activity results from a balance, involving enzyme production and activation counterpoised by enzyme degradation and inhibition. The involvement of syndecan ectodomains in regulating proteolytic balance could explain several observations, including the variability of elastase activity and the inconsistency of fibronectin degradation in wound fluids (11). Our finding that both HS degradation and immunodepletion of syndecan ectodomains reduce the proteolytic activity of acute wound fluids (Figs. 6 and 7) indicates that FIG. 6. Elastolytic activity of wound fluid is balanced by endogenous heparan sulfate. A, endogenous elastolytic activity in human acute dermal wound fluids was assessed before (Ⅺ) and after the addition of heparin (q, 2 g/ml; f, 5 g/ml) by adding the the synthetic substrate (CBZ-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala) 2 -R110 and measuring hydrolysis over time. B, human wound fluids were treated with 150 milliunits/ml of Hase and HSase for 3 h at 37°C in 50 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, or with buffer alone. Elastolytic activity was measured in untreated (Ⅺ) and Hase/HSase-treated fluids before (OE) and 5 min after (f) the addition of 5 g/ml heparin. The Hase/HSase mixture itself contained no detectable elastolytic activity, nor did it directly effect the activity of proteases in test reactions. Each of three acute (day 1) wound fluids tested showed reduced elastolytic activity after HS degradation, which was reversed after heparin addition.
FIG. 7. Depletion of syndecan-1 and -4 from human acute dermal wound fluids reduces their elastolytic activity. Human acute wound fluid was incubated with purified monoclonal antibodies against human syndecan-1 (MCA-681 and DL-101) and syndecan-4 (5G9 and 8C7) (q) or with equal concentrations of mouse IgG (Ⅺ). Following immunoprecipitations, the supernatants were tested for elastolytic activity by adding the synthetic substrate (CBZ-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala) 2 -R110 and measuring the hydrolysis over time. Each of five acute (day 1) wound fluids tested showed reduced endogenous elastolytic activity after immunodepletion of syndecan-1 and -4 (33-60% lower rate). Activity in a representative experiment is shown. these soluble proteoglycans contribute to balanced proteolytic activity in the wound environment.
Alterations in proteolytic balance are thought to be one reason why acute wounds do not heal properly and become chronic (11,40). The high levels of proteolytic activity in chronic wound fluid have led to the proposal that misregulated proteases contribute to the inability of chronic wounds to heal even when treated with exogenous matrix and growth factors (41,42). Whether alterations in the levels of syndecan ectodomains could lead to loss of proteolytic balance and thus to development of chronic wounds needs investigation.
Abnormalities in Proteolytic Balance-Optimal proteolytic activity is needed for normal wound repair. Formation of the fibrin-rich provisional matrix produced after tissue injury is an initial step in the repair process. Once the fibrin clot has formed, migrating keratinocytes at the wound edge and emigrating neutrophils produce a variety of serine proteases and matrix metalloproteases to degrade this matrix and close the wound. An imbalance of proteases and serpins contributes to chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, and the development of vascular plaques of atherosclerosis and amyloid plaques in the central nervous system in Alzheimer's disease (9). Whether or not syndecans have a role in regulating proteolytic activities in these events is not known, but in light of our data, this possibility seems worth investigating.
We have found that syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains act within human acute wound fluids to maintain proteolytic balance. Although no evidence so far exists, the ectodomains of other heparan sulfate proteoglycans that can be shed, such as glypican-1 and CD-44 (Refs. 43 and 29, respectively), might act similarly. Altered proteolytic balance in the wound environment has the potential to interfere with therapeutic procedures ranging from growth factor application to skin grafting. Thus, syndecan expression and shedding should be considered in evaluating and attempting to modify the response to tissue injury.

FIG. 1 .

1Syndecan-1 ectodomain binds cathepsin G and elastase via its heparan sulfate chains. ACE of the soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain with cathepsin G (A and B) and elastase (C and D) is shown. [ 35 S]Sulfate-labeled syndecan-1 ectodomain was electrophoresed through agarose gels containing various concentrations of cathepsin G (A) or elastase (C) as described under "Experimental Procedures." The effects of chondroitin 6-sulfate (1 mg/ml) and heparin (1 mg/ml) on the [ 35 S]sulfate-labeled syndecan-1 ectodomain binding to cathepsin G (B) and elastase (D) are shown. Equal amounts of [ 35 S]sulfate-labeled syndecan-1 ectodomain were introduced into each slot, the electrophoresis was run, and distribution of radioactivity on the gel was visualized by autoradiography. The concentrations of proteases are indicated below each lane.

3Syndecan-1 ectodomain reduces cathepsin G and elastase activities and their inhibition by serpins.A, increasing concentrations of syndecan-1 ectodomain were incubated for 15 min with cathepsin G (q), cathepsin G and ␣ 1 -Achy (Ⅺ), or cathepsin G and SCCA2 (E), and the enzymatic activity was measured with the synthetic substrate Suc-AAPF-pNA. B, increasing concentrations of syndecan-1 ectodomain were incubated for 15 min with elastase (q) or elastase and ␣ 1 -PI (⅜), and the enzymatic activity was measured with synthetic substrate (CBZ-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala)2 -R110. Final concentrations: A, [CatG] ϭ 34 nM, [␣ 1 -Achy] ϭ 34 nM, [SCCA2] ϭ 34 nM, [Suc-AAPF-pNA] ϭ 3 mM; B, [neutrophil elastase] ϭ 34 nM, [␣ 1 -PI] ϭ 34 nM, [(CBZ-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala) 2 -R110] ϭ 5 M. Relative activity is the rate relative to the rate observed in the absence of the ectodomain.

FIG. 2 .

2Syndecan-1 ectodomain does not alter the stoichiometry of protease-serpin complex formation. Increasing concentrations of serpin were mixed with a constant concentration of protease without addition (Ⅺ) and in the presence of syndecan-1 ectodomain (f) or heparin (q). Final concentrations: A, [CatG] ϭ 34 nM, [Suc-AAPF-pNA] ϭ 3 mM, 16.5 g/ml syndecan-1 ectodomain HS, 16.5 g/ml heparin; B, [CatG] ϭ 34 nM, [Suc-AAPF-pNA] ϭ 3 mM, 10 g/ml syndecan-1 ectodomain HS, 10 g/ml heparin; C, [neutrophil elastase] (NE) ϭ 34 nM, [(CBZ-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala)2 -R110] ϭ 5 M, 7.5 g/ml syndecan-1 ectodomain HS, 7.5 g/ml heparin. Relative activity is the rate relative to the rate observed in the absence of serpin. The lines are drawn by the least squares method from data obtained without GAG. Addition of GAG did not statistically affect the 1:1 stoichiometry.

5Syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains are in acute wound fluids. Acute human dermal wound fluids (WF, days 1-3) were made cell-free by centrifugation, and samples (20 l) were blotted on Immobilon N membrane. Human syndecan-) and syndecan-4 ectodomain (0, 10, 20, 40, and 80 ng) glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were blotted as standards. The syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains were detected by ECL using antibodies HSE-1 and 5G9, respectively. FIG. 4. Syndecan-1 protects cathepsin G from inhibition by ␣ 1 -Achy and SCCA2 and elastase from ␣ 1 -PI. A, progress curves for the inhibition of cathepsin G by ␣ 1 -Achy in the absence (Ⅺ) or presence of 1.0 g/ml untreated (q), heparinase-treated (‚), or heparinase and heparitinase-treated (OE) syndecan-1 ectodomain. B, progress curves for the inhibition of cathepsin G by SCCA2 in the absence (E) or presence of 0.5 g/ml untreated (q), heparinase-treated (‚) or heparinase and heparitinase-treated (OE) syndecan-1 ectodomain. C, progress curves for the inhibition of elastase by ␣ 1 -PI in the absence (E) or presence of 1.5 g/ml untreated (q), heparinase-treated (‚), or heparitinase-treated (ƒ) syndecan-1 ectodomain. Final concentrations: A, [CatG] ϭ 34 nM, [␣ 1 -Achy] ϭ 34 nM, [Suc-AAPF-pNA] ϭ 3 mM; B, [CatG] ϭ 34 nM, [SCCA2] ϭ 34 nM, [Suc-AAPF-pNA] ϭ 3 mM; C, [neutrophil elastase] ϭ 34 nM, [␣ 1 -PI] ϭ 34 nM, [(CBZ-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala) 2 -R110] ϭ 5 M.
-R110 for elastase was from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Heparin (porcine intestinal mucosa) was from Hepar Industries Inc. (Franklin, OH), and chondroitin-6 sulfate, chondroitin sulfate ABC lyase (chondroitinase ABC, EC 4.2.2.4), heparan sulfate lyase III (heparitinase, EC 4.2.2.8), and heparan-sulfate lyase I (heparinase, EC 4.2.2.7) were from Seikagaku America Inc.
