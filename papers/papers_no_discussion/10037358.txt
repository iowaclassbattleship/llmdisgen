Effectiveness of biomarker-based exclusion of ventilator-acquired pneumonia to reduce antibiotic use (VAPrapid-2): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial Background Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) constitute a group vulnerable to healthcare-associated infection (HCAI), and consistent with that, antibiotic consumption in the ICU is considerably higher than in other hospital environments {{16152062}}. The growing global challenge of antimicrobial-resistance requires improved antibiotic stewardship. This judgment is, however, challenging in critically ill patients in whom clinical signs of infection are non-specific and where the consequences of missing a treatable infection may be significant.
Ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) is a common ICU HCAI and highlights the challenges of antibiotic stewardship. Few clinical features have a specificity of greater than 60 % {{not_in_s2orc}}{{8340831}}{{8178883}}, and infection is confirmed in approximately 40 % of patients with suspected VAP {{17391743}}. The majority of patients with suspected VAP have antibiotics started at the point of clinical suspicion and de-escalation or discontinuation of antibiotics is possible after 2-3 days, when culture information becomes available. During this period, a significant proportion of patients will receive antibiotics that may not be indicated, and furthermore, if antibiotics are not discontinued in light of negative cultures, a full course of unnecessary antibiotics may be administered.
Addressing limitations in diagnostic methods for infections has the potential to improve antibiotic management by expediting the diagnostic process. Biomarkers of infection can act as rapid surrogate markers. In a recent multi-centre observational study {{17391743}}, we validated the findings of a single-centrederivation study {{5156253}}{{2617662}}, showing that bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid biomarkers could form a reliable test to exclude VAP. Low concentrations of BAL fluid interleukin 1-beta (IL-1β) consistently have a strong negative predictive value (NPV) in both the derivation and validation cohorts. Furthermore, in the validation cohort, a combination of IL-1β and IL-8 could be used as a biomarker test to rule out VAP with high confidence, with a NPV of 1 and a post-test probability of 0 % (95 % confidence interval 0-9.2 %). These biomarkers are measured by cytometric bead array (CBA), which is a multi-plex, flow cytometric application that can be performed in approximately 6 hours, offering the potential for a rapid biomarker-based test in the ICU.
The aim of this randomised trial is to determine if, in adult patients with suspected VAP, the use of the additional rule-out biomarker test will improve antibiotic management and reduce antimicrobial use in comparison to decision making based on microbiology results alone.
Methods/Design

This protocol outlines a multi-centre, prospective, controlled trial in which patients with suspected VAP are randomised 1:1 to a rapid biomarker-rule-out test in addition to standard care, compared to standard care alone (clinical judgment plus standard microbiological culture). The primary outcome measure is antibiotic-free days (AFD) in the 7 days following BAL. This clinical trial adheres to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement (Fig. 1) {{5387743}} and principles of Good Clinical Practice.
Study population

Participants are being recruited from the ICUs of 17 National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in the UK, for a total of 22 ICUs. These ICUs cover a broad case mix of medical, surgical and trauma patients, who are representative of current practice across the NHS.
Patients with suspected VAP who are at least 18 years of age, intubated and mechanically ventilated for 48 hours or more are considered eligible for inclusion in the trial. VAP is suspected based on the presence of a new or worsening chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) changes consistent with pneumonia in the context of at least two of the following: temperature < 35°C or > 38°C; a white cell count of < 4 × 10 9 / L or > 11 × 10 9 / L; or purulent tracheal secretions {{14907563}}. Patients must also be considered suitable for early discontinuation of antibiotics by the clinical team (i.e. have no extra-pulmonary source of infection that mandates the use of continued antibiotics).
Patients are excluded on the basis of previously published criteria {{39264424}} that predict poor tolerance of the bronchoscopy and BAL that have been previously applied in our studies {{17391743}}{{2617662}}. These are: PaO 2 < 8kPa on a FiO 2 > 0.7; positive end-expiratory pressure of > 15 cm H 2 O; peak airway pressure > 35 cm H 2 O; heart rate > 140 beats per minute; mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg; bleeding diathesis including platelet count < 20 × 10 9 /L or international normalised ratio (INR) > 3; poorly controlled intracranial pressure (>20 mmHg); or ICU consultant deems the procedure not to be safe. Patients may only be randomised to the study once (i.e. they are excluded if they have had previous BAL as part of the study). Patients are also excluded if assent/ consent is declined.
Co-enrolment is allowed with observational studies. Co-enrolment with interventional studies is allowed following consideration of any scientific or statistical interactions in accordance with current UK recommendations {{72495254}}.
Biomarker assay and laboratory set up

The biomarker assay is performed in six NHS or university laboratories that act as testing 'hubs'. Participating ICUs had to be within an expected travel time of 1.5 hours of a hub. BAL fluid samples are transported to the laboratory on ice immediately after sampling and measurement of BAL fluid IL-1β and IL-8 by cytometric bead array is performed with minimal delay on arrival. IL-1β and IL-8 are combined by logistic regression by the equation, established in the validation study {{17391743}}:
VAP is excluded if the regression output falls below a defined level (-1.7616). All equipment, reagents and ongoing maintenance are supplied by the study's industry partner, Becton Dickinson Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Each hub has been issued an Accuri C6 flow cytometer. This is a benchtop flow cytometer designed for its ease of use. The biomarker assay and all Accuri standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been designed such that they can be carried out by healthcare service laboratory technicians with limited flow cytometry experience. Centralised training in the biomarker assay and Accuri C6 was provided by investigators and scientists from Newcastle University and Becton Dickinson.
Accuri quality control tests are performed once a week by each hub, and these data are monitored by the flow cytometry core facility in Newcastle University. Technical support is provided by the investigators at Newcastle University and by Becton Dickinson.
Intervention

All patients enrolled in the trial have suspected VAP and undergo the same clinical procedures of bronchoscopy and BAL. The BAL is performed according to a previously described SOP {{17391743}}.
Patients are randomised to have BAL samples analysed by either the biomarker test in addition to semiquantitative culture (the intervention arm) or semiquantitative cultures alone (the control arm). The intervention arm is referred to as the 'biomarker-guided recommendation on antibiotics' group and the control arm the 'routine use of antibiotics' group. All semiquantitative cultures are performed in a NHS or Public Health England laboratory and handled by a SOP in accordance with the UK Standards for Microbiological Investigation {{not_in_s2orc}}. VAP is confirmed by the widely used threshold of growth of a potential pathogen at > 10 4 colony-forming units per ml (CFU/ml) {{1369998}}.
Biomarker results are reported to the clinical team by the technician using a standard script after approximately 6 hours. It is anticipated that all patients would have antibiotics started at the point of suspicion of VAP. In the event of a biomarker result that falls below the cut-off value, the clinical team is advised that VAP is excluded with high confidence and that early discontinuation of antibiotics is advised. If the biomarker value is above the threshold the clinical team is advised that VAP cannot be excluded and that standard care should continue.
Risk to participants

Patients enrolled in this trial are by definition critically unwell, and minimising the risk to these patients is of paramount importance. BAL is an established and widely used technique for sampling the alveolar regions in ICU patients {{1369998}}{{11640076}}. Not only do eligibility criteria exclude patients who would poorly tolerate a BAL, but patients can be excluded based on the clinicians' judgment of the risk profile.
The second consideration of risk is around the early discontinuation of antibiotics. The risk exists that antibiotics may be incorrectly discontinued in the face of undetected infection (i.e. in the setting of a false negative biomarker test). The validation study demonstrated that the threshold for excluding VAP using BAL IL-1β and IL-8 had an NPV of 1 which gives confidence in the test's performance, but with a 95 % confidence interval of 0.92-1.0 false negatives remaining possible. Decisions around antibiotic prescribing are not dictated by the trial protocol, and these ultimately remain at the discretion of the treating clinician. This allows the clinician to restart antibiotics if it is felt they were discontinued inappropriately. This minimises the risk to patients and also makes the trial more pragmatic, testing its use in 'real life' clinical practice.
Primary outcome and sample size

The primary outcome measure is the frequency distribution of AFD in the 7 days following BAL. This interval was used as this is the average reported duration of antibiotic therapy for suspected VAP in UK practice {{17287844}}. For the purposes of study design, AFD can be considered to be an integer value with patients in one of eight categories (0-7 AFD). Fewer days of antibiotic treatment will be detected as an increase in the proportion of patients with higher numbers of AFD and fewer patients having zero AFD. Antimicrobials delivered for prophylaxis will be excluded from analysis.
The sample size is based on the frequency distribution of AFD in the 7 days after BAL in our previous validation study. This baseline distribution of AFD showed a skew towards patients with suspected VAP having few or no AFD (with this effect manifest both in those with ultimately confirmed VAP and those in whom BAL microbiology did not confirm VAP). We modelled changes in the distribution of AFD from baseline to a distribution with more patients having higher numbers of AFD. Table 1 gives examples of the different frequency distributions and their effect sizes. We judged a distribution that equates to effect sizes above 0.07 would represent a clinically important difference. By way of illustration, this would be equivalent to a change from a baseline median of 0 AFD (interquartile range 0-2.5 AFD) to a median of 1.5 AFD (interquartile range 0-3.5 AFD) under biomarker-guided treatment. An effect size of 0.0797 requires 90 patients per trial arm and allowing for a 15 % drop out, the total sample size is 210. This outcome measure and effect size was presented for national stakeholder peer review and judged to be appropriate (UK Critical Care Research Forum, July 2013). Figure 2 illustrates the changes in the AFD distribution between baseline and model 3 from Table 1.
Secondary outcome measures

Secondary outcome measures will include antibiotic days and AFD, expressed as continuous variables, at 7, 14 and 28 days; ventilator-free days at 28 days; 28-day mortality and ICU mortality; sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score at days 3, 7 and 14; duration of level 2 (high dependency unit) care, level 3 (intensive care unit) care and hospital stay; Clostridium difficile and MRSA infections up to hospital discharge, death or 56 days; and antibiotic-resistant pathogen cultures up to hospital discharge, death or 56 days. A healthcare-resource-utilisation analysis will be calculated from the duration of level 2 care, level 3 care and hospital stay up to discharge, death or 56 days.
Since this is a trial of a complex intervention, a process evaluation will be carried out in parallel with this trial. This will evaluate the process of conducting the trial and will aim to determine reasons for potential discrepancies in the expected and observed trial outcome, as well as providing information on the potential implementation of the intervention after trial completion. Additional files outline the detailed study protocol for the process evaluation (see Additional files 1 and 2).

Data collection

Data are collected on the day of enrolment (day 0); day 3; day 7; day 14; day 28; and date of discharge, death or at 56 days. Clinical data collected include the age, gender, date of admission to the hospital and ICU, reason for admission to the hospital and ICU, functional comorbidities index, acute physiology and chronic health Table 1 Models of different frequency distribution of AFD. Standard care distribution is based on data obtained from our validation cohort. The different models demonstrate increasing shifts in the frequency distribution towards more AFD in the sample. These distributions are illustrative, and different proportions in each category could give the same effect size.

Safety measures will be recorded relative to the bronchoscopy and BAL. These will include SaO 2 , heart rate, blood pressure and PaO 2 :FiO 2 . Biological data will include concentrations of IL-1β and IL-8 in the BAL fluid for patients who are randomised to the intervention arm.
Recruitment process and consent

All patients on the participating ICUs are screened on weekdays for eligibility. Potentially eligible patients are discussed with the ICU consultant to determine the appropriateness of early discontinuation of antibiotics and whether any other safety concerns are present that would exclude the patient.
Consent and assent procedures are in keeping with the legal framework of England, Northern Ireland (Mental Capacity Act, 2005) or Scotland (Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act, 2000) for consent/assent of adults without capacity. In England and Northern Ireland informed assent is obtained, where possible, following discussion with the patient's next of kin (personal consultee). Where a personal consultee is unavailable, assent is provided by a nominated consultee, usually the ICU consultant, providing they are not also a member of the research team. In circumstances where the next of kin are unable to attend the ICU promptly, eliciting their opinion is possible by telephone to inform nominated assent.
In Scotland the patient's relative or welfare attorney provides the informed consent. If the patient's relative or welfare attorney is unable to attend the ICU, consent may be provided in a telephone conversation, providing a second member of staff witnesses the discussion.
Patients who recover capacity will be approached to provide retrospective informed consent. The decision as to whether that patient has regained capacity will reside with the treating team. The patient will be given sufficient time to consider the trial information before providing their consent to continued trial involvement.
Randomisation and blinding

Once consent/assent is obtained, the clinical team informs the laboratory technician who will perform the biomarker test, and the technician then initiates randomisation through the Newcastle Clinical Trials Unit (NCTU). Randomisation is performed using a webbased randomisation service. Patients are randomised to the intervention arm or control arm in a 1:1 ratio by permuted blocks of variable length and stratified by site. The randomisation service generates either an instruction that the patient is randomised to 'biomarker-guided recommendation on antibiotics: analyse sample on arrival' or to 'routine use of antibiotics: do not analyse sample on arrival'. This message is emailed to the technician.
The clinical team is initially blinded to the trial arm since all trial procedures are performed in all participants. Unblinding occurs when the biomarker result is called back to the clinical team after approximately 6 hours. To ensure consistency in unblinding, after this period, the clinical team are also informed if the patient was randomised to the control arm. The technician contacts the clinical team with the results according to local arrangements, which include contacting the on-call ICU consultant, ICU resident or the local principal investigator.
Statistical analysis

Baseline clinical data will be compared between trial arms for balance using graphical and summary statistics appropriate for the data type of each variable. No formal tests of equality will be carried out. The primary outcome measure will be analysed by a chi-squared test on a 2 × 8 table of study arm versus AFD categories. Secondary outcome measures will be analysed by fitting appropriate generalised linear models with intervention and centre as covariates. Link functions will be determined by the type of outcome variable. A sub-group analysis for patients with trauma or head injury will be included as will a sub-group analysis based on clinician assessment of likelihood of VAP. Data analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis, although other exploratory analyses including per-protocol analysis will be considered. A per-protocol analysis will be performed excluding patients who were randomised to the biomarker-guided recommendation on antibiotics arm, but who had a technical issue with the assay and therefore defaulted to standard care.
A within-trial cost analysis will be undertaken to assess the hospital resource use from the point of randomisation until hospital discharge or death, whichever occurs first, for a maximum of 56 days. Patient-level hospital resource use will be estimated from length of ICU stay and length of hospital stay. Multiple regression analyses will be performed to examine patient factors, which are potentially associated with costs. The robustness of the results will be evaluated using sensitivity analyses.
Monitoring and adverse event reporting

A Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee will have oversight of the trial. This is an independent body that has oversight of safety data. They will make recommendations to the sponsor as to whether the trial should progress, be modified or terminated.
NCTU will monitor adherence to the trial protocol and completeness of the data collection. Adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) that occur within 2 hours of BAL are reported to NCTU. Site investigators are able to report an AE/SAE outside of this period if they feel an AE/SAE is related to the study.

17391743:Diagnostic accuracy of pulmonary host inflammatory mediators in the exclusion of ventilator-acquired pneumonia


INTRODUCTION

Antibiotic resistance has been increasing rapidly, making antibiotic stewardship a priority for healthcare systems globally. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) receive a significant burden of antibiotics. 1 Ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) occurs in 10%-20% of the ICU population. 2 VAP poses a dilemma for clinicians seeking to improve antibiotic stewardship. The diagnosis of VAP is challenging and pulmonary infection is confirmed in only approximately 30% of patients with suspected VAP. 3 4 Despite this, since VAP is associated with significant mortality and morbidity, and because significant delays in appropriate treatment have been linked to increases in mortality, 5 patients are often treated with antibiotics from the moment of initial suspicion. This is compounded by the fact that conventional microbiology culture and sensitivity results typically take up to 72 h to return to clinicians.
Novel biomarker-based diagnostic techniques, if suitably accurate and rapid, would offer a significant change in the clinical information available at the time of suspected infection and could reduce

Key messages

What is the key question?
▸ Ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) is notoriously difficult to diagnose clinically, so this multicentre study aimed to determine whether VAP could be rapidly and accurately excluded by quantifying host biomarkers.
What is the bottom line?
▸ Low concentrations of interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-8 effectively exclude VAP using a system that yields results within 6 h.

Why read on?

▸ To our knowledge, this is the first study to validate the effective, rapid exclusion of VAP using host proteins, paving the way for future trials assessing whether these markers can improve antibiotic stewardship in the intensive care unit.
Critical care unnecessary antibiotic use. However, to our knowledge, no protein biomarkers showing promise in initial derivation studies have gone on to yield confirmatory diagnostic utility in multicentre validation studies. In a single-centre derivation cohort, mediators of the host inflammatory response measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from patients with suspected VAP demonstrated potential as biomarkers for the exclusion of pneumonia. In particular, low concentrations of BAL fluid interleukin (IL)-1β appeared to be able to rule out VAP effectively. 6 IL-8 and the neutrophil proteases matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), MMP-9 and human neutrophil elastase (HNE) also showed promise in excluding VAP. 7 We, therefore, conducted a pragmatic multicentre validation study of these five BAL fluid biomarkers in patients with suspected VAP.

METHODS


Study design and participants

We conducted a prospective, multicentre, observational study in 12 general UK ICUs, with screening performed on week days between February 2012 and February 2013. A wide case mix of medical, surgical and trauma patients was represented. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or more and if they had been endotracheally intubated and mechanically ventilated for at least 48 h. VAP was suspected if the patient had new or worsening alveolar shadowing on chest radiograph (CXR) and if at least 2 of the following criteria were present: purulent tracheal secretions; temperature <35°C or >38°C; or a blood white cell count <4×10 9 /L or >11×10 9 /L. Patients were excluded based on criteria predicting poor tolerance of bronchoscopy and BAL: PaO 2 <8 kPa on FiO 2 >0.7; positive end-expiratory pressure >15 cm H 2 O; peak airway pressure >35 cm H 2 O; heart rate >140 bpm; mean arterial pressure <65 mm Hg; bleeding diathesis (including platelet count <20×10 9 /L or international normalised ratio >3); or intracranial pressure >20 mm Hg. Patients were also excluded if the ICU clinician responsible for the patient's care considered the procedure to be unsafe, if the patient had a previous BAL as part of this study or if consent/ assent was not obtained. Consent or assent was obtained according to approved procedures for incapacitated adults. The study was approved by the appropriate research ethics committees within the National Research Ethics Service (England and Northern Ireland (11/NE/ 0242), Scotland (11/SS/0089)). Study monitoring and oversight were provided by Newcastle Clinical Trials Unit.

Procedures

Participants underwent a protocolised bronchoscopy and BAL performed by either the clinical team or local investigators. In summary, BAL was performed in a region of the lung corresponding to an area of new alveolar infiltrate on CXR. If multiple areas were involved, the BAL was performed in a segment or subsegment from which purulent secretions were visualised. If the CXR changes were extensive or there was doubt over which segment to lavage, the posterior segment of the right lower lobe was sampled. 8 Patients received 100% oxygen and sedation with or without paralysis according to the clinical team's preference. The bronchoscope was gently wedged in the segment to be lavaged. The first 20 mL saline instillate was aspirated and discarded. Thereafter, three 40 mL aliquots of saline were instilled, aspirated and pooled.
A 2 mL aliquot of BAL fluid was sent to a National Health Service or Public Health England microbiology laboratory for semiquantitative culture. BAL fluid was handled according to a standard operating procedure in accordance with the UK Standards for Microbiological Investigation. 9 VAP was confirmed by growth of potential pathogens at >10 4 colony forming units per millilitre (cfu/mL), the value of which as a reference test in VAP has been discussed extensively elsewhere. 2 Sterile specimens or growth below this threshold identified the 'non-VAP' group. The remaining BAL fluid was centrifuged at 700 g for 10 min. The supernatant was aspirated and stored frozen for subsequent biomarker quantification, which was performed at a single site (Newcastle University) at the end of study recruitment. Therefore, routine clinical care was provided to all patients involved, without access to biomarker results.
Biomarkers in BAL fluid were measured by cytometric bead array (CBA) and analysed using an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, New Jersey, USA). Results are generated within approximately 4 h. Levels of IL-1β, IL-8, MMP-8, MMP-9 and HNE were determined in BAL fluid in a 5-bead multiplex according to the manufacturer's instructions. CBA kits for IL-1β and IL-8 were commercially available, whereas CBA kits for MMP-8, MMP-9 and HNE were custommade for the study. All samples were measured in dilutions of 1:5, 1:50 and 1:500. Samples which fell below the standard range in the 1:5 dilution were repeated using undiluted BAL fluid. CBA was carried out by a single trained investigator, who was unaware of the culture results, in a separate laboratory to which BAL fluid cultures were performed.
Clinical data were collected on ICU length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, time to ICU and hospital discharge, in-hospital mortality, ICU mortality, admission category (medical or surgical), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score on admission, use of renal replacement therapy, use of vasopressors, use of corticosteroids and whether criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome were met. 10 Data were also collected on antibiotic use on day of enrolment and during the preceding 72 h; and antibiotic days and antibioticfree days (AFD) in the 7 days following BAL.

Statistical considerations

Sample size was estimated from the derivation study post-test probability (PTP) of VAP using the IL-1β threshold value for exclusion. 6 Below the threshold, IL-1β excluded VAP with a PTP of 2.8% (95% CI 0.1% to 15.9%). To improve the external validity of this result, a sample size was based on narrowing the 95% CI. We estimated that 24% of patients would have confirmed VAP based on the derivation cohort. A sample size of 140 was estimated to allow a 95% CI for a PTP of 3% to be 0% to 8%, which was judged tight enough for potential clinical use. We, therefore, planned to recruit 160 patients to allow for a dropout rate of approximately 15%.
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS V.19 (Chicago, Illinois, USA) and R 3.0.0. 11 Comparisons for non-normally distributed continuous data were made with the Mann-Whitney U test, otherwise with the Student t test. Binary outcomes were analysed using the χ 2 test.
Since the objective was to validate a rule-out for VAP, the statistical analysis was performed to determine the maximum sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV). Patients were dichotomised into a VAP group and non-VAP group according to growth in BAL fluid of >10 4 cfu/mL or ≤10 4 cfu/mL. Individual biomarkers that were significantly different between groups were analysed by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) procedures. Biomarkers were log 10 transformed with the addition of a constant of one before being tested in combination. Log 10 transformed biomarkers were entered into a logistic regression model and ROC curves were constructed from the predictive model. Cut-points for individual biomarkers and combinations were determined by fixing a minimum NPV of 95%. The diagnostic rules, diagnostic performance measures and associated 95% CIs were derived using the OptimalCutpoints library in R3.0.0. 12

RESULTS

Four hundred and fifteen patients satisfied criteria for suspected VAP, of whom 248 had exclusion criteria. Of the remaining 167 patients, 150 had paired microbiological culture and biomarker results from BAL fluid and were entered into the analysis. Fifty-three patients (35%) had confirmed VAP and the remaining 97 (65%) patients comprised the non-VAP group. The Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) diagram is provided at the end of the Results section, after the rationale for the optimal diagnostic test has been described.
The VAP and non-VAP groups were similar in terms of demographics and clinical characteristics (table 1). The VAP group was associated with less use of antibiotics prior to BAL, less use of corticosteroids and a higher proportion of surgical patients, but only the first of these was statistically significant (table 1).
The organisms grown at >10 4 cfu/mL are shown in table 2. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for approximately 60% of identified organisms, Gram-positive organisms 30% and fungi 10%. In the VAP group, 39 patients (73%) had growth of a single micro-organism, 12 (23%) had two micro-organisms and 2 patients had three micro-organisms cultured at >10 4 cfu/mL.
One hundred and ten patients (73.3%) were receiving antibiotics at the time of BAL, but only 35 patients (23.3%) had a new antibiotic started in the 72 h before BAL, with no significant difference between the VAP and non-VAP groups (p=0.078). In the 7 days following BAL, 57.6% of patients had no AFD, with the median AFD being 0 (IQR 0-2) days. The distribution of AFD in the 7 days following BAL is shown in figure 1. There were significant differences in the concentrations of IL-1β, IL-8, MMP-8, MMP-9 and HNE in BAL fluid when comparing the VAP and non-VAP groups (p<0.001 for all comparisons) (table 3). Therefore, ROC curves were constructed for all 5 biomarkers to determine diagnostic utility and optimum cut-off points. Selecting cut-points to obtain a minimum NPV of    The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for the IL-1β/IL-8 combination was 0.81 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.88) (figure 2). Our aim of achieving a high NPV resulted in a lower specificity; however, either of these biomarker combinations could exclude VAP with a PTP of 0% (95% CI 0% to 7.8% for the 4-biomarker combination; 0% to 9.2% for the 2-biomarker combination). A 2-biomarker combination would have pragmatic advantages over a 4-biomarker combination for future clinical application. As a further validation of the logistic regression model, the 2biomarker model was applied to the biomarkers from the derivation cohort. 6 7 The resulting AUROC was 0.85 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.94). Using the same cut-point of −1.7616 yielded a sensitivity of 94.1%, a specificity of 56.4% and an NPV of 96.9%.
The STARD diagram for the study is shown in figure 3.

DISCUSSION

This multicentre validation cohort from a broad ICU population yielded results very similar to those from our previous single-centre derivation cohort. The optimal cut-offs for IL-1β were also similar in the 2 studies (10 vs 17 pg/mL), the small difference probably being explained by the lower volume of BAL instilled in this study (120 mL vs 200 mL). The data, therefore, potentially provide important information towards the development of new, rapid diagnostic strategies for infection in the ICU. Successful validation of initially promising derivation studies has represented a major hurdle in the development of new diagnostics in the ICU setting. Of the five biomarkers investigated, all were significantly higher in VAP than in the non-VAP group. We demonstrate that IL-1β, in particular, is a powerful biomarker for the exclusion of VAP. Indeed, when the diagnostic utility of combinations of biomarkers was tested, IL-1β was the predominant component of all models. The combination of IL-1β and IL-8 could exclude VAP with an NPV of 1, suggesting this simple combination has significant potential as a rule-out test for VAP. The cutpoint was selected with the aim of determining the optimal characteristics for exclusion of VAP. With an NPV of 1 but a positive predictive value of 0.50, the biomarkers reflect the performance of a satisfactory 'rule-out' test. Furthermore, this assay typically takes approximately 4 h to perform, yielding a rapid and novel biomarker combination to exclude VAP. There is growing evidence that short courses of antibiotics for suspected sepsis in the ICU may be safe. In contrast, there is evidence that overuse of antibiotics could be harmful. 13 Our data suggest that if empirical antibiotics were started in all patients with suspected VAP, they could potentially be discontinued with high confidence within a few hours in response to low IL-1β and IL-8 concentrations in BAL fluid. If clinicians were prepared to change antibiotic prescription based on the rule-out results, we estimate that up to 30% of patients with suspected VAP could have early   Biomarkers were log 10 transformed with the addition of a constant of one before fitting into logistic regression for combinations of biomarkers.

To our knowledge, no other biomarkers have been shown to be so robust for the exclusion of VAP. The most widely investigated biomarkers in VAP are procalcitonin and type 1 soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (sTREM-1), which have been analysed in both BAL fluid and serum. [14][15][16] In addition, other biomarkers, including elastin fibres, copeptin, nitrated proteins, serum β-d-glucan, pancreatic stone protein, midregional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide, pentraxin 3, Clara cell protein, leucocyte RNA profiles, leptin, and gene expression, have been investigated. [17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27] These biomarkers have generally shown inconsistent results, often with poor diagnostic or prognostic utility. The biomarkers analysed in the present study potentially have biological plausibility in that IL-1β and IL-8 are pro-inflammatory cytokines, while MMP-8, MMP-9 and HNE may be released from activated neutrophils during degranulation, and one might expect these mediators to be elevated in regions of lung in which there is active infection.
The diagnostic criteria and method of sampling used have been variable in previous biomarker studies in suspected VAP. Although debate continues over the merits of bronchoscopic and non-bronchoscopic methods for respiratory sampling in terms of clinical outcomes, the need for consistent alveolar sampling is probably of greater importance when measuring biomarkers in suspected VAP. VAP is known to be a patchy process, 8  and 'blind' BAL methods may (at least theoretically) either sample unaffected alveolar regions or, worse, proximal nonalveolar airway. When seeking VAP, it seems logical to sample the alveolar regions of radiologically affected lung. Although one other study did not show any diagnostic utility from IL-1β, 16 this variance to our findings may be due to sampling by mini-BAL. Our results can only be extrapolated from the protocolised BAL used in this study, and certainly our cut-off values cannot be extrapolated to mini-BAL, for example. Although the practical implications and cost of BAL may be perceived as potential disincentives, BAL is a common procedure in the ICU and the full cost implications can only be considered once the impact on antibiotic prescribing has been determined in future studies.
Our study has a number of potential limitations. As with many ICU studies, exclusion criteria eliminated 60% of patients who met inclusion criteria, potentially reducing the generalisability. A caveat of our reliance on BAL sampling is that some patients are too unstable to tolerate the procedure. We estimate that 67 patients (16%) who met inclusion criteria were excluded on safety grounds precluding bronchoscopy (data not shown).
A further potential limitation is that a large proportion of patients (73.3%) were on antibiotics at the time of BAL, which could potentially have resulted in false negative microbiology and, perhaps, even falsely low biomarker levels. However, far fewer patients had a new antibiotic started in the 72 h before BAL (23.3%) with no significant difference between the VAP and non-VAP groups. Importantly, this was a pragmatic validation study, and excluding patients on antibiotics would have further limited its generalisability. Performing a subanalysis of IL-1β to exclude patients who received new antibiotics in 72 h before BAL (therefore including 69 non-VAP and 46 VAP patients) resulted in an AUROC of 0.78 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.87), suggesting that the effect of antibiotics may not be of great significance.
An additional consideration is that our 'standard' for the diagnosis of VAP-potential pathogens at >10 4 cfu/mL in BAL fluid -is imperfect. If a patient is on an antibiotic at the time of BAL and a pathogen sensitive to that antibiotic is cultured, but at <10 4 cfu/mL, clinicians may find it hard to be absolutely confident that VAP is excluded. The obvious difficulty here is that the true diagnostic 'gold standard' of simultaneous culture and histological examination of infected and inflamed alveolar tissue is impractical. In this setting, quantitative culture generally performs at least as well as other suggested diagnostic modalities, and better than clinical diagnosis without sampling. 2 28 Taken overall, we can only conclude that our study validates the performance of IL-1β and IL-8 in the specific setting of the protocolised BAL and the definition of VAP used here.
Furthermore, determining the highest achievable sensitivity comes at the cost of specificity. As the specificity decreases, the proportion of non-VAP patients correctly ruled out by the biomarker combination reduces. However, this trade-off is necessary to exclude VAP with the lowest possible PTP, to give the clinician confidence in the rule-out performance and therefore allow early antibiotic discontinuation. We also recognise that a blood marker(s) excluding VAP would be far more desirable than BAL fluid markers, given that some patients may not be suitable for BAL and that there is potential interoperator technical variability in BAL. However, at present, no good blood biomarkers exist in this context.
A further issue concerns the ongoing controversy as to whether Candida spp in BAL fluid at >10 4 cfu/mL are contaminants or potentially pathogenic. We included Candida on the basis that, in critically ill patients, clinicians may find it hard to ignore potential pathogens at such high concentrations from an affected region of lung. In any event, isolated growth of Candida was rare in our hands. Finally, a diagnostic test is only valuable if it beneficially alters practice, and it remains to be seen whether clinicians will be prepared to alter antibiotic use based on a biomarker test-this requires to be scrutinised formally in the setting of a randomised controlled trial.
In summary, this study confirms that IL-1β effectively excludes VAP when validated in a multicentre study. Performance is improved further by the addition of IL-8, and the combination could form a relatively simple, rapid diagnostic assay to exclude VAP. Biomarker analysis appears to have the potential to improve antibiotic stewardship early in the course of suspected VAP. Whether this concept can lead to effective improvements in antibiotic stewardship remains to be seen and should be the focus of randomised controlled trials.

95% resulted in unacceptably low specificity for IL-8, MMP-8 and HNE(table 4).Log 10 transformed biomarkers were highly correlated, with Pearson's correlation coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.93. IL-1β was the strongest individual predictor of VAP; therefore, combinations of biomarkers were tested with IL-1β. ROC curves were constructed for combinations and performance at optimal cut-points derived. The top performing biomarker combinations were IL-1β/IL-8/MMP-8/MMP-9 (cut-point −1.7015 on the scale of the linear predictor) with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 46.4%, and IL-1β/IL-8 (cut-point −1.7616 on the scale of the linear predictor) with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 44.3%(table 4).

Introduction

Randomised controlled trials, when appropriately designed, conducted, and reported, represent the gold standard in evaluating healthcare interventions. However, randomised trials can yield biased results if they lack methodological rigour [1]. To assess a trial accurately, readers of a published report need complete, clear, and transparent information on its methodology and findings. Unfortunately, attempted assessments frequently fail because authors of many trial reports neglect to provide lucid and complete descriptions of that critical information [2][3][4].
That lack of adequate reporting fuelled the development of the original CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement in 1996 [5] and its revision five years later [6][7][8]. While those statements improved the reporting quality for some randomised controlled trials, [9,10] many trial reports still remain inadequate [2]. Furthermore, new methodological evidence and additional experience has accumulated since the last revision in 2001. Consequently, we organised a CONSORT Group meeting to update the 2001 statement [6][7][8]. We introduce here the result of that process, CONSORT 2010.

Intent of CONSORT 2010

The CONSORT 2010 Statement is this paper including the 25 item checklist in the table (Table 1) and the flow diagram ( Figure 1). It provides guidance for reporting all randomised controlled trials, but focuses on the most common design type-individually randomised, two group, parallel trials. Other trial designs, such as cluster randomised trials and non-inferiority trials, require varying amounts of additional information. CONSORT extensions for these designs, [11,12] and other CON-SORT products, can be found through the CONSORT website http://www.consort-statement.org. Along with the CONSORT statement, we have updated the explanation and elaboration article, [13] which explains the inclusion of each checklist item, provides methodological background, and gives published examples of transparent reporting.
Diligent adherence by authors to the checklist items facilitates clarity, completeness, and transparency of reporting. Explicit descriptions, not ambiguity or omission, best serve the interests of all readers. Note that the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing, conducting, and analysing trials. It solely addresses the reporting of what was done and what was found.
Nevertheless, CONSORT does indirectly affect design and conduct. Transparent reporting reveals deficiencies in research if they exist. Thus, investigators who conduct inadequate trials, but who must transparently report, should not be able to pass through the publication process without revelation of their trial's inadequacies. That emerging reality should provide impetus to improved trial design and conduct in the future, a secondary indirect goal of our work. Moreover, CONSORT can help researchers in designing their trial.  Background to CONSORT Efforts to improve the reporting of randomised controlled trials accelerated in the mid-1990s, spurred partly by methodological research. Researchers had shown for many years that authors reported such trials poorly, and empirical evidence began to accumulate that some poorly conducted or poorly reported aspects of trials were associated with bias [14]. Two initiatives aimed at developing reporting guidelines culminated in one of us (DM) and Drummond Rennie organising the first CONSORT statement in 1996 [5]. Further methodological research on similar topics reinforced earlier findings [15] and fed into the revision of 2001 [6][7][8]. Subsequently, the expanding body of methodological research informed the refinement of CONSORT 2010. More than 700 studies com-prise the CONSORT database (located on the CONSORT website), which provides the empirical evidence to underpin the CONSORT initiative. Indeed, CONSORT Group members continually monitor the literature. Information gleaned from these efforts provides an evidence base on which to update the CON-SORT statement. We add, drop, or modify items based on that evidence and the recommendations of the CON-SORT Group, an international and eclectic group of clinical trialists, statisticians, epidemiologists, and biomedical editors. The CONSORT Executive (KFS, DGA, DM) strives for a balance of established and emerging researchers. The membership of the group is dynamic. As our work expands in response to emerging projects and needed expertise, we invite new members to contribute. Sources of funding and other support (such as supply of drugs), role of funders *We strongly recommend reading this statement in conjunction with the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13] for important clarifications on all the items. If relevant, we also recommend reading CONSORT extensions for cluster randomised trials [11], non-inferiority and equivalence trials [12], non-pharmacological treatments [32], herbal interventions [33], and pragmatic trials [34]. Additional extensions are forthcoming: for those and for up to date references relevant to this checklist, see http://www.consort-statement.org.

Table 1: CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a randomised trial* (Continued)

As such, CONSORT continually assimilates new ideas and perspectives. That process informs the continually evolving CONSORT statement. Over time, CONSORT has garnered much support. More than 400 journals, published around the world and in many languages, have explicitly supported the CON-SORT statement. Many other healthcare journals support it without our knowledge. Moreover, thousands more have implicitly supported it with the endorsement of the CONSORT statement by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors http://www.icmje.org. Other prominent editorial groups, the Council of Science Editors and the World Association of Medical Editors, officially support CONSORT. That support seems warranted: when used by authors and journals, CON-SORT seems to improve reporting [9].

Development of CONSORT 2010

Thirty one members of the CONSORT 2010 Group met in Montebello, Canada, in January 2007 to update the 2001 CONSORT statement. In addition to the accumulating evidence relating to existing checklist items, several new issues had come to prominence since 2001. Some participants were given primary responsibility for aggre-gating and synthesising the relevant evidence on a particular checklist item of interest. Based on that evidence, the group deliberated the value of each item. As in prior CONSORT versions, we kept only those items deemed absolutely fundamental to reporting a randomised controlled trial. Moreover, an item may be fundamental to a trial but not included, such as approval by an institutional ethical review board, because funding bodies strictly enforce ethical review and medical journals usually address reporting ethical review in their instructions for authors. Other items may seem desirable, such as reporting on whether on-site monitoring was done, but a lack of empirical evidence or any consensus on their value cautions against inclusion at this point. The CONSORT 2010 Statement thus addresses the minimum criteria, although that should not deter authors from including other information if they consider it important.
After the meeting, the CONSORT Executive convened teleconferences and meetings to revise the checklist. After seven major iterations, a revised checklist was distributed to the larger group for feedback. With that feedback, the executive met twice in person to consider all the comments and to produce a penultimate version. That served as the basis for writing the first draft of this paper, which was then distributed to the group for feedback. After consideration of their comments, the executive finalised the statement.
The CONSORT Executive then drafted an updated explanation and elaboration manuscript, with assistance from other members of the larger group. The substance of the 2007 CONSORT meeting provided the material for the update. The updated explanation and elaboration manuscript was distributed to the entire group for additions, deletions, and changes. That final iterative process converged to the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13].

Changes in CONSORT 2010

The revision process resulted in evolutionary, not revolutionary, changes to the checklist (Table 1), and the flow diagram was not modified except for one word (Figure 1). Moreover, because other reporting guidelines augmenting the checklist refer to item numbers, we kept the existing items under their previous item numbers except for some renumbering of items 2 to 5. We added additional items either as a sub-item under an existing item, an entirely new item number at the end of the checklist, or (with item 3) an interjected item into a renumbered segment. We have summarised the noteworthy general changes in Appendix 1 and specific changes in Appendix 2. The CONSORT website contains a side by side comparison of the 2001 and 2010 versions.

Implications and limitations

We developed CONSORT 2010 to assist authors in writing reports of randomised controlled trials, editors and peer reviewers in reviewing manuscripts for publication, and readers in critically appraising published articles. The CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration provides elucidation and context to the checklist items. We strongly recommend using the explanation and elaboration in conjunction with the checklist to foster complete, clear, and transparent reporting and aid appraisal of published trial reports.
CONSORT 2010 focuses predominantly on the two group, parallel randomised controlled trial, which accounts for over half of trials in the literature [2]. Most of the items from the CONSORT 2010 Statement, however, pertain to all types of randomised trials. Nevertheless, some types of trials or trial situations dictate the need for additional information in the trial report. When in doubt, authors, editors, and readers should consult the CONSORT website for any CONSORT extensions, expansions (amplifications), implementations, or other guidance that may be relevant.
The evidence based approach we have used for CON-SORT also served as a model for development of other reporting guidelines, such as for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies evaluating interventions [16], diagnostic studies [17], and observational studies [18]. The explicit goal of all these initiatives is to improve reporting. The Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network will facilitate development of reporting guidelines and help disseminate the guidelines: http://www.equator-network.org provides information on all reporting guidelines in health research.
With CONSORT 2010, we again intentionally declined to produce a rigid structure for the reporting of randomised trials. Indeed, SORT [19] tried a rigid format, and it failed in a pilot run with an editor and authors [20]. Consequently, the format of articles should abide by journal style, editorial directions, the traditions of the research field addressed, and, where possible, author preferences. We do not wish to standardise the structure of reporting. Authors should simply address checklist items somewhere in the article, with ample detail and lucidity. That stated, we think that manuscripts benefit from frequent subheadings within the major sections, especially the methods and results sections.
CONSORT urges completeness, clarity, and transparency of reporting, which simply reflects the actual trial design and conduct. However, as a potential drawback, a reporting guideline might encourage some authors to report fictitiously the information suggested by the guidance rather than what was actually done. Authors, peer reviewers, and editors should vigilantly guard against that potential drawback and refer, for example, to trial protocols, to information on trial registers, and to regulatory agency websites. Moreover, the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing and conducting randomised trials. The items should elicit clear pronouncements of how and what the authors did, but do not contain any judgments on how and what the authors should have done. Thus, CONSORT 2010 is not intended as an instrument to evaluate the quality of a trial. Nor is it appropriate to use the checklist to construct a "quality score."
Nevertheless, we suggest that researchers begin trials with their end publication in mind. Poor reporting allows authors, intentionally or inadvertently, to escape scrutiny of any weak aspects of their trials. However, with wide adoption of CONSORT by journals and editorial groups, most authors should have to report transparently all important aspects of their trial. The ensuing scrutiny rewards well conducted trials and penalises poorly conducted trials. Thus, investigators should understand the CONSORT 2010 reporting guidelines before starting a trial as a further incentive to design and conduct their trials according to rigorous standards.
CONSORT 2010 supplants the prior version published in 2001. Any support for the earlier version accumulated from journals or editorial groups will automatically extend to this newer version, unless specifically requested otherwise. Journals that do not currently support CON-SORT may do so by registering on the CONSORT website. If a journal supports or endorses CONSORT 2010, it should cite one of the original versions of CONSORT 2010, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration, and the CONSORT website in their "Instructions to authors." We suggest that authors who wish to cite CON-SORT should cite this or another of the original journal versions of CONSORT 2010 Statement, and, if appropriate, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13]. All CONSORT material can be accessed through the original publishing journals or the CONSORT website. Groups or individuals who desire to translate the CON-SORT 2010 Statement into other languages should first consult the CONSORT policy statement on the website.
We emphasise that CONSORT 2010 represents an evolving guideline. It requires perpetual reappraisal and, if necessary, modifications. In the future we will further revise the CONSORT material considering comments, criticisms, experiences, and accumulating new evidence. We invite readers to submit recommendations via the CONSORT website.

Appendix 1: Noteworthy general changes in CONSORT 2010 Statement

• We simplified and clarified the wording, such as in items 1, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, and 21 • We improved consistency of style across the items by removing the imperative verbs that were in the 2001 version
• We enhanced specificity of appraisal by breaking some items into sub-items. Many journals expect authors to complete a CONSORT checklist indicating where in the manuscript the items have been addressed. Experience with the checklist noted pragmatic difficulties when an item comprised multiple elements. For example, item 4 addresses eligibility of participants and the settings and locations of data collection. With the 2001 version, an author could provide a page number for that item on the checklist, but might have reported only eligibility in the paper, for example, and not reported the settings and locations. CONSORT 2010 relieves obfuscations and forces authors to provide page numbers in the checklist for both eligibility and settings.

Appendix 2: Noteworthy specific changes in CONSORT 2010 Statement

Item 1b (title and abstract)-We added a sub-item on providing a structured summary of trial design, methods, results, and conclusions and referenced the CONSORT for abstracts article [21].

Item 2b (introduction)-We added a new sub-item (formerly item 5 in CONSORT 2001) on "Specific objectives or hypotheses"

Item 3a (trial design)-We added a new item including this sub-item to clarify the basic trial design (such as parallel group, crossover, cluster) and the allocation ratio Item 3b (trial design)-We added a new sub-item that addresses any important changes to methods after trial commencement, with a discussion of reasons

Item 4 (participants)-Formerly item 3 in CONSORT 2001

Item 5 (interventions)-Formerly item 4 in CONSORT 2001. We encouraged greater specificity by stating that descriptions of interventions should include "sufficient details to allow replication" [3] Item 6 (outcomes)-We added a sub-item on identifying any changes to the primary and secondary outcome (endpoint) measures after the trial started. This followed from empirical evidence that authors frequently provide analyses of outcomes in their published papers that were not the prespecified primary and secondary outcomes in their protocols, while ignoring their prespecified outcomes (that is, selective outcome reporting) [4,22]. We eliminated text on any methods used to enhance the quality of measurements Item 9 (allocation concealment mechanism)-We reworded this to include mechanism in both the report topic and the descriptor to reinforce that authors should report the actual steps taken to ensure allocation concealment rather than simply report imprecise, perhaps banal, assurances of concealment Item 11 (blinding)-We added the specification of how blinding was done and, if relevant, a description of the similarity of interventions and procedures. We also eliminated text on "how the success of blinding (masking) was assessed" because of a lack of empirical evidence supporting the practice as well as theoretical concerns about the validity of any such assessment [23,24] Item 12a (statistical methods)-We added that statistical methods should also be provided for analysis of secondary outcomes Sub-item 14b (recruitment)-Based on empirical research, we added a sub-item on "Why the trial ended or was stopped" [25] Item 15 (baseline data)-We specified "A table" to clarify that baseline and clinical characteristics of each group are most clearly expressed in a table Item 16 (numbers analysed)-We replaced mention of "intention to treat" analysis, a widely misused term, by a more explicit request for information about retaining participants in their original assigned groups [26] Sub-item 17b (outcomes and estimation)-For appropriate clinical interpretability, prevailing experience suggested the addition of "For binary outcomes, presentation of both relative and absolute effect sizes is recommended" [27] Item 19 (harms)-We included a reference to the CON-SORT paper on harms [28] Item 20 (limitations)-We changed the topic from "Interpretation" and supplanted the prior text with a sentence focusing on the reporting of sources of potential bias and imprecision Item 22 (interpretation)-We changed the topic from "Overall evidence." Indeed, we understand that authors should be allowed leeway for interpretation under this nebulous heading. However, the CONSORT Group expressed concerns that conclusions in papers frequently misrepresented the actual analytical results and that harms were ignored or marginalised. Therefore, we changed the checklist item to include the concepts of results matching interpretations and of benefits being balanced with harms Item 23 (registration)-We added a new item on trial registration. Empirical evidence supports the need for trial registration, and recent requirements by journal editors have fostered compliance [29] Item 24 (protocol)-We added a new item on availability of the trial protocol. Empirical evidence suggests that authors often ignore, in the conduct and reporting of their trial, what they stated in the protocol [4,22]. Hence, availability of the protocol can instigate adherence to the protocol before publication and facilitate assessment of adherence after publication Item 25 (funding)-We added a new item on funding. Empirical evidence points toward funding source sometimes being associated with estimatedeatment effects [30] Competing interests Uniform disclosure of potential conflicts of interest: all authors have completed the ICMJE unified competing interest form at http://www.icmje.org/ coi_disclosure.pdf (available from the corresponding author) and declare (1) DM received grants for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; KFS and DGA received support for travel to meetings for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; (2) KFS and DA had travel expenses reimbursed by the EQUATOR Network; KFS has received honoraria for delivering educational presentations for the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology Foundation for Excellence in Women's Health Care, Ortho-McNeil Janssen Scientific Affairs, and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology; and has done consultancy for Wyeth.

Authors' contributions KFS, DM, and DGA participated in meetings and regular conference calls, planned the CONSORT 2007 meeting at Montebello, developed the agenda, prepared background research, identified and invited participants, contributed to the CONSORT meeting, drafted the manuscript, and, after critical review by the CONSORT Group, finalised the text of the manuscript. Members of the CONSORT Group attended the meeting, except for those noted below, and provided input on and review of the revised checklist and text of this article. Some members also prepared background material.
Randomised controlled trials, when appropriately designed, conducted, and reported, represent the gold standard in evaluating healthcare interventions. However, randomised trials can yield biased results if they lack methodological rigour [1]. To assess a trial accurately, readers of a published report need complete, clear, and transparent information on its methodology and findings. Unfortunately, attempted assessments frequently fail because authors of many trial reports neglect to provide lucid and complete descriptions of that critical information [2][3][4].
That lack of adequate reporting fuelled the development of the original CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement in 1996 [5] and its revision five years later [6][7][8]. While those statements improved the reporting quality for some randomised controlled trials, [9,10] many trial reports still remain inadequate [2]. Furthermore, new methodological evidence and additional experience has accumulated since the last revision in 2001. Consequently, we organised a CONSORT Group meeting to update the 2001 statement [6][7][8]. We introduce here the result of that process, CONSORT 2010.
The CONSORT 2010 Statement is this paper including the 25 item checklist in the table (Table 1) and the flow diagram ( Figure 1). It provides guidance for reporting all randomised controlled trials, but focuses on the most common design type-individually randomised, two group, parallel trials. Other trial designs, such as cluster randomised trials and non-inferiority trials, require varying amounts of additional information. CONSORT extensions for these designs, [11,12] and other CON-SORT products, can be found through the CONSORT website http://www.consort-statement.org. Along with the CONSORT statement, we have updated the explanation and elaboration article, [13] which explains the inclusion of each checklist item, provides methodological background, and gives published examples of transparent reporting.
Diligent adherence by authors to the checklist items facilitates clarity, completeness, and transparency of reporting. Explicit descriptions, not ambiguity or omission, best serve the interests of all readers. Note that the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing, conducting, and analysing trials. It solely addresses the reporting of what was done and what was found.
Nevertheless, CONSORT does indirectly affect design and conduct. Transparent reporting reveals deficiencies in research if they exist. Thus, investigators who conduct inadequate trials, but who must transparently report, should not be able to pass through the publication process without revelation of their trial's inadequacies. That emerging reality should provide impetus to improved trial design and conduct in the future, a secondary indirect goal of our work.

Empirical evidence points toward funding source sometimes being associated with estimatedeatment effects [30] Competing interests Uniform disclosure of potential conflicts of interest: all authors have completed the ICMJE unified competing interest form at http://www.icmje.org/ coi_disclosure.pdf (available from the corresponding author) and declare (1) DM received grants for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; KFS and DGA received support for travel to meetings for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; (2) KFS and DA had travel expenses reimbursed by the EQUATOR Network; KFS has received honoraria for delivering educational presentations for the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology Foundation for Excellence in Women's Health Care, Ortho-McNeil Janssen Scientific Affairs, and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology; and has done consultancy for Wyeth. All authors also declare (3) no spouses, partners, or children with relationships with commercial entities that might have an interest in the submitted work; (4) no non-financial interests that may be relevant to the submitted work.
Authors' contributions KFS, DM, and DGA participated in meetings and regular conference calls, planned the CONSORT 2007 meeting at Montebello, developed the agenda, prepared background research, identified and invited participants, contributed to the CONSORT meeting, drafted the manuscript, and, after critical review by the CONSORT Group, finalised the text of the manuscript. Members of the CONSORT Group attended the meeting, except for those noted below, and provided input on and review of the revised checklist and text of this article. Some members also prepared background material.
Randomised controlled trials, when appropriately designed, conducted, and reported, represent the gold standard in evaluating healthcare interventions. However, randomised trials can yield biased results if they lack methodological rigour [1]. To assess a trial accurately, readers of a published report need complete, clear, and transparent information on its methodology and findings. Unfortunately, attempted assessments frequently fail because authors of many trial reports neglect to provide lucid and complete descriptions of that critical information [2][3][4].
That lack of adequate reporting fuelled the development of the original CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement in 1996 [5] and its revision five years later [6][7][8]. While those statements improved the reporting quality for some randomised controlled trials, [9,10] many trial reports still remain inadequate [2]. Furthermore, new methodological evidence and additional experience has accumulated since the last revision in 2001. Consequently, we organised a CONSORT Group meeting to update the 2001 statement [6][7][8]. We introduce here the result of that process, CONSORT 2010.
The CONSORT 2010 Statement is this paper including the 25 item checklist in the table (Table 1) and the flow diagram ( Figure 1). It provides guidance for reporting all randomised controlled trials, but focuses on the most common design type-individually randomised, two group, parallel trials. Other trial designs, such as cluster randomised trials and non-inferiority trials, require varying amounts of additional information. CONSORT extensions for these designs, [11,12] and other CON-SORT products, can be found through the CONSORT website http://www.consort-statement.org. Along with the CONSORT statement, we have updated the explanation and elaboration article, [13] which explains the inclusion of each checklist item, provides methodological background, and gives published examples of transparent reporting.
Diligent adherence by authors to the checklist items facilitates clarity, completeness, and transparency of reporting. Explicit descriptions, not ambiguity or omission, best serve the interests of all readers. Note that the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing, conducting, and analysing trials. It solely addresses the reporting of what was done and what was found.
Nevertheless, CONSORT does indirectly affect design and conduct. Transparent reporting reveals deficiencies in research if they exist. Thus, investigators who conduct inadequate trials, but who must transparently report, should not be able to pass through the publication process without revelation of their trial's inadequacies. That emerging reality should provide impetus to improved trial design and conduct in the future, a secondary indirect goal of our work. Moreover, CONSORT can help researchers in designing their trial.  Background to CONSORT Efforts to improve the reporting of randomised controlled trials accelerated in the mid-1990s, spurred partly by methodological research. Researchers had shown for many years that authors reported such trials poorly, and empirical evidence began to accumulate that some poorly conducted or poorly reported aspects of trials were associated with bias [14]. Two initiatives aimed at developing reporting guidelines culminated in one of us (DM) and Drummond Rennie organising the first CONSORT statement in 1996 [5]. Further methodological research on similar topics reinforced earlier findings [15] and fed into the revision of 2001 [6][7][8]. Subsequently, the expanding body of methodological research informed the refinement of CONSORT 2010. More than 700 studies com-prise the CONSORT database (located on the CONSORT website), which provides the empirical evidence to underpin the CONSORT initiative. Indeed, CONSORT Group members continually monitor the literature. Information gleaned from these efforts provides an evidence base on which to update the CON-SORT statement. We add, drop, or modify items based on that evidence and the recommendations of the CON-SORT Group, an international and eclectic group of clinical trialists, statisticians, epidemiologists, and biomedical editors. The CONSORT Executive (KFS, DGA, DM) strives for a balance of established and emerging researchers. The membership of the group is dynamic. As our work expands in response to emerging projects and needed expertise, we invite new members to contribute. Sources of funding and other support (such as supply of drugs), role of funders *We strongly recommend reading this statement in conjunction with the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13] for important clarifications on all the items. If relevant, we also recommend reading CONSORT extensions for cluster randomised trials [11], non-inferiority and equivalence trials [12], non-pharmacological treatments [32], herbal interventions [33], and pragmatic trials [34]. Additional extensions are forthcoming: for those and for up to date references relevant to this checklist, see http://www.consort-statement.org.
As such, CONSORT continually assimilates new ideas and perspectives. That process informs the continually evolving CONSORT statement. Over time, CONSORT has garnered much support. More than 400 journals, published around the world and in many languages, have explicitly supported the CON-SORT statement. Many other healthcare journals support it without our knowledge. Moreover, thousands more have implicitly supported it with the endorsement of the CONSORT statement by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors http://www.icmje.org. Other prominent editorial groups, the Council of Science Editors and the World Association of Medical Editors, officially support CONSORT. That support seems warranted: when used by authors and journals, CON-SORT seems to improve reporting [9].
Thirty one members of the CONSORT 2010 Group met in Montebello, Canada, in January 2007 to update the 2001 CONSORT statement. In addition to the accumulating evidence relating to existing checklist items, several new issues had come to prominence since 2001. Some participants were given primary responsibility for aggre-gating and synthesising the relevant evidence on a particular checklist item of interest. Based on that evidence, the group deliberated the value of each item. As in prior CONSORT versions, we kept only those items deemed absolutely fundamental to reporting a randomised controlled trial. Moreover, an item may be fundamental to a trial but not included, such as approval by an institutional ethical review board, because funding bodies strictly enforce ethical review and medical journals usually address reporting ethical review in their instructions for authors. Other items may seem desirable, such as reporting on whether on-site monitoring was done, but a lack of empirical evidence or any consensus on their value cautions against inclusion at this point. The CONSORT 2010 Statement thus addresses the minimum criteria, although that should not deter authors from including other information if they consider it important.
After the meeting, the CONSORT Executive convened teleconferences and meetings to revise the checklist. After seven major iterations, a revised checklist was distributed to the larger group for feedback. With that feedback, the executive met twice in person to consider all the comments and to produce a penultimate version. That served as the basis for writing the first draft of this paper, which was then distributed to the group for feedback. After consideration of their comments, the executive finalised the statement.
The CONSORT Executive then drafted an updated explanation and elaboration manuscript, with assistance from other members of the larger group. The substance of the 2007 CONSORT meeting provided the material for the update. The updated explanation and elaboration manuscript was distributed to the entire group for additions, deletions, and changes. That final iterative process converged to the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13].
The revision process resulted in evolutionary, not revolutionary, changes to the checklist (Table 1), and the flow diagram was not modified except for one word (Figure 1). Moreover, because other reporting guidelines augmenting the checklist refer to item numbers, we kept the existing items under their previous item numbers except for some renumbering of items 2 to 5. We added additional items either as a sub-item under an existing item, an entirely new item number at the end of the checklist, or (with item 3) an interjected item into a renumbered segment. We have summarised the noteworthy general changes in Appendix 1 and specific changes in Appendix 2. The CONSORT website contains a side by side comparison of the 2001 and 2010 versions.
We developed CONSORT 2010 to assist authors in writing reports of randomised controlled trials, editors and peer reviewers in reviewing manuscripts for publication, and readers in critically appraising published articles. The CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration provides elucidation and context to the checklist items. We strongly recommend using the explanation and elaboration in conjunction with the checklist to foster complete, clear, and transparent reporting and aid appraisal of published trial reports.
CONSORT 2010 focuses predominantly on the two group, parallel randomised controlled trial, which accounts for over half of trials in the literature [2]. Most of the items from the CONSORT 2010 Statement, however, pertain to all types of randomised trials. Nevertheless, some types of trials or trial situations dictate the need for additional information in the trial report. When in doubt, authors, editors, and readers should consult the CONSORT website for any CONSORT extensions, expansions (amplifications), implementations, or other guidance that may be relevant.
The evidence based approach we have used for CON-SORT also served as a model for development of other reporting guidelines, such as for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies evaluating interventions [16], diagnostic studies [17], and observational studies [18]. The explicit goal of all these initiatives is to improve reporting. The Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network will facilitate development of reporting guidelines and help disseminate the guidelines: http://www.equator-network.org provides information on all reporting guidelines in health research.
With CONSORT 2010, we again intentionally declined to produce a rigid structure for the reporting of randomised trials. Indeed, SORT [19] tried a rigid format, and it failed in a pilot run with an editor and authors [20]. Consequently, the format of articles should abide by journal style, editorial directions, the traditions of the research field addressed, and, where possible, author preferences. We do not wish to standardise the structure of reporting. Authors should simply address checklist items somewhere in the article, with ample detail and lucidity. That stated, we think that manuscripts benefit from frequent subheadings within the major sections, especially the methods and results sections.
CONSORT urges completeness, clarity, and transparency of reporting, which simply reflects the actual trial design and conduct. However, as a potential drawback, a reporting guideline might encourage some authors to report fictitiously the information suggested by the guidance rather than what was actually done. Authors, peer reviewers, and editors should vigilantly guard against that potential drawback and refer, for example, to trial protocols, to information on trial registers, and to regulatory agency websites. Moreover, the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing and conducting randomised trials. The items should elicit clear pronouncements of how and what the authors did, but do not contain any judgments on how and what the authors should have done. Thus, CONSORT 2010 is not intended as an instrument to evaluate the quality of a trial. Nor is it appropriate to use the checklist to construct a "quality score."
Nevertheless, we suggest that researchers begin trials with their end publication in mind. Poor reporting allows authors, intentionally or inadvertently, to escape scrutiny of any weak aspects of their trials. However, with wide adoption of CONSORT by journals and editorial groups, most authors should have to report transparently all important aspects of their trial. The ensuing scrutiny rewards well conducted trials and penalises poorly conducted trials. Thus, investigators should understand the CONSORT 2010 reporting guidelines before starting a trial as a further incentive to design and conduct their trials according to rigorous standards.
CONSORT 2010 supplants the prior version published in 2001. Any support for the earlier version accumulated from journals or editorial groups will automatically extend to this newer version, unless specifically requested otherwise. Journals that do not currently support CON-SORT may do so by registering on the CONSORT website. If a journal supports or endorses CONSORT 2010, it should cite one of the original versions of CONSORT 2010, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration, and the CONSORT website in their "Instructions to authors." We suggest that authors who wish to cite CON-SORT should cite this or another of the original journal versions of CONSORT 2010 Statement, and, if appropriate, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13]. All CONSORT material can be accessed through the original publishing journals or the CONSORT website. Groups or individuals who desire to translate the CON-SORT 2010 Statement into other languages should first consult the CONSORT policy statement on the website.
We emphasise that CONSORT 2010 represents an evolving guideline. It requires perpetual reappraisal and, if necessary, modifications. In the future we will further revise the CONSORT material considering comments, criticisms, experiences, and accumulating new evidence. We invite readers to submit recommendations via the CONSORT website.
• We simplified and clarified the wording, such as in items 1, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, and 21 • We improved consistency of style across the items by removing the imperative verbs that were in the 2001 version
• We enhanced specificity of appraisal by breaking some items into sub-items. Many journals expect authors to complete a CONSORT checklist indicating where in the manuscript the items have been addressed. Experience with the checklist noted pragmatic difficulties when an item comprised multiple elements. For example, item 4 addresses eligibility of participants and the settings and locations of data collection. With the 2001 version, an author could provide a page number for that item on the checklist, but might have reported only eligibility in the paper, for example, and not reported the settings and locations. CONSORT 2010 relieves obfuscations and forces authors to provide page numbers in the checklist for both eligibility and settings.
Item 1b (title and abstract)-We added a sub-item on providing a structured summary of trial design, methods, results, and conclusions and referenced the CONSORT for abstracts article [21].
Item 3a (trial design)-We added a new item including this sub-item to clarify the basic trial design (such as parallel group, crossover, cluster) and the allocation ratio Item 3b (trial design)-We added a new sub-item that addresses any important changes to methods after trial commencement, with a discussion of reasons
Item 5 (interventions)-Formerly item 4 in CONSORT 2001. We encouraged greater specificity by stating that descriptions of interventions should include "sufficient details to allow replication" [3] Item 6 (outcomes)-We added a sub-item on identifying any changes to the primary and secondary outcome (endpoint) measures after the trial started. This followed from empirical evidence that authors frequently provide analyses of outcomes in their published papers that were not the prespecified primary and secondary outcomes in their protocols, while ignoring their prespecified outcomes (that is, selective outcome reporting) [4,22]. We eliminated text on any methods used to enhance the quality of measurements Item 9 (allocation concealment mechanism)-We reworded this to include mechanism in both the report topic and the descriptor to reinforce that authors should report the actual steps taken to ensure allocation concealment rather than simply report imprecise, perhaps banal, assurances of concealment Item 11 (blinding)-We added the specification of how blinding was done and, if relevant, a description of the similarity of interventions and procedures. We also eliminated text on "how the success of blinding (masking) was assessed" because of a lack of empirical evidence supporting the practice as well as theoretical concerns about the validity of any such assessment [23,24] Item 12a (statistical methods)-We added that statistical methods should also be provided for analysis of secondary outcomes Sub-item 14b (recruitment)-Based on empirical research, we added a sub-item on "Why the trial ended or was stopped" [25] Item 15 (baseline data)-We specified "A table" to clarify that baseline and clinical characteristics of each group are most clearly expressed in a table Item 16 (numbers analysed)-We replaced mention of "intention to treat" analysis, a widely misused term, by a more explicit request for information about retaining participants in their original assigned groups [26] Sub-item 17b (outcomes and estimation)-For appropriate clinical interpretability, prevailing experience suggested the addition of "For binary outcomes, presentation of both relative and absolute effect sizes is recommended" [27] Item 19 (harms)-We included a reference to the CON-SORT paper on harms [28] Item 20 (limitations)-We changed the topic from "Interpretation" and supplanted the prior text with a sentence focusing on the reporting of sources of potential bias and imprecision Item 22 (interpretation)-We changed the topic from "Overall evidence." Indeed, we understand that authors should be allowed leeway for interpretation under this nebulous heading. However, the CONSORT Group expressed concerns that conclusions in papers frequently misrepresented the actual analytical results and that harms were ignored or marginalised. Therefore, we changed the checklist item to include the concepts of results matching interpretations and of benefits being balanced with harms Item 23 (registration)-We added a new item on trial registration. Empirical evidence supports the need for trial registration, and recent requirements by journal editors have fostered compliance [29] Item 24 (protocol)-We added a new item on availability of the trial protocol. Empirical evidence suggests that authors often ignore, in the conduct and reporting of their trial, what they stated in the protocol [4,22]. Hence, availability of the protocol can instigate adherence to the protocol before publication and facilitate assessment of adherence after publication Item 25 (funding)-We added a new item on funding. Empirical evidence points toward funding source sometimes being associated with estimatedeatment effects [30] Competing interests Uniform disclosure of potential conflicts of interest: all authors have completed the ICMJE unified competing interest form at http://www.icmje.org/ coi_disclosure.pdf (available from the corresponding author) and declare (1) DM received grants for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; KFS and DGA received support for travel to meetings for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; (2) KFS and DA had travel expenses reimbursed by the EQUATOR Network; KFS has received honoraria for delivering educational presentations for the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology Foundation for Excellence in Women's Health Care, Ortho-McNeil Janssen Scientific Affairs, and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology; and has done consultancy for Wyeth.

We encouraged greater specificity by stating that descriptions of interventions should include "sufficient details to allow replication" [3] Item 6 (outcomes)-We added a sub-item on identifying any changes to the primary and secondary outcome (endpoint) measures after the trial started. This followed from empirical evidence that authors frequently provide analyses of outcomes in their published papers that were not the prespecified primary and secondary outcomes in their protocols, while ignoring their prespecified outcomes (that is, selective outcome reporting) [4,22]. We eliminated text on any methods used to enhance the quality of measurements Item 9 (allocation concealment mechanism)-We reworded this to include mechanism in both the report topic and the descriptor to reinforce that authors should report the actual steps taken to ensure allocation concealment rather than simply report imprecise, perhaps banal, assurances of concealment Item 11 (blinding)-We added the specification of how blinding was done and, if relevant, a description of the similarity of interventions and procedures. We also eliminated text on "how the success of blinding (masking) was assessed" because of a lack of empirical evidence supporting the practice as well as theoretical concerns about the validity of any such assessment [23,24] Item 12a (statistical methods)-We added that statistical methods should also be provided for analysis of secondary outcomes Sub-item 14b (recruitment)-Based on empirical research, we added a sub-item on "Why the trial ended or was stopped" [25] Item 15 (baseline data)-We specified "A table" to clarify that baseline and clinical characteristics of each group are most clearly expressed in a table Item 16 (numbers analysed)-We replaced mention of "intention to treat" analysis, a widely misused term, by a more explicit request for information about retaining participants in their original assigned groups [26] Sub-item 17b (outcomes and estimation)-For appropriate clinical interpretability, prevailing experience suggested the addition of "For binary outcomes, presentation of both relative and absolute effect sizes is recommended" [27] Item 19 (harms)-We included a reference to the CON-SORT paper on harms [28] Item 20 (limitations)-We changed the topic from "Interpretation" and supplanted the prior text with a sentence focusing on the reporting of sources of potential bias and imprecision Item 22 (interpretation)-We changed the topic from "Overall evidence." Indeed, we understand that authors should be allowed leeway for interpretation under this nebulous heading. However, the CONSORT Group expressed concerns that conclusions in papers frequently misrepresented the actual analytical results and that harms were ignored or marginalised. Therefore, we changed the checklist item to include the concepts of results matching interpretations and of benefits being balanced with harms Item 23 (registration)-We added a new item on trial registration. Empirical evidence supports the need for trial registration, and recent requirements by journal editors have fostered compliance [29] Item 24 (protocol)-We added a new item on availability of the trial protocol. Empirical evidence suggests that authors often ignore, in the conduct and reporting of their trial, what they stated in the protocol [4,22]. Hence, availability of the protocol can instigate adherence to the protocol before publication and facilitate assessment of adherence after publication Item 25 (funding)-We added a new item on funding. Empirical evidence points toward funding source sometimes being associated with estimatedeatment effects [30] Competing interests Uniform disclosure of potential conflicts of interest: all authors have completed the ICMJE unified competing interest form at http://www.icmje.org/ coi_disclosure.pdf (available from the corresponding author) and declare (1) DM received grants for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; KFS and DGA received support for travel to meetings for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; (2) KFS and DA had travel expenses reimbursed by the EQUATOR Network; KFS has received honoraria for delivering educational presentations for the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology Foundation for Excellence in Women's Health Care, Ortho-McNeil Janssen Scientific Affairs, and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology; and has done consultancy for Wyeth.

Authors' contributions KFS, DM, and DGA participated in meetings and regular conference calls, planned the CONSORT 2007 meeting at Montebello, developed the agenda, prepared background research, identified and invited participants, contributed to the CONSORT meeting, drafted the manuscript, and, after critical review by the CONSORT Group, finalised the text of the manuscript. Members of the CONSORT Group attended the meeting, except for those noted below, and provided input on and review of the revised checklist and text of this article. Some members also prepared background material.
Randomised controlled trials, when appropriately designed, conducted, and reported, represent the gold standard in evaluating healthcare interventions. However, randomised trials can yield biased results if they lack methodological rigour [1]. To assess a trial accurately, readers of a published report need complete, clear, and transparent information on its methodology and findings. Unfortunately, attempted assessments frequently fail because authors of many trial reports neglect to provide lucid and complete descriptions of that critical information [2][3][4].
That lack of adequate reporting fuelled the development of the original CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement in 1996 [5] and its revision five years later [6][7][8]. While those statements improved the reporting quality for some randomised controlled trials, [9,10] many trial reports still remain inadequate [2]. Furthermore, new methodological evidence and additional experience has accumulated since the last revision in 2001. Consequently, we organised a CONSORT Group meeting to update the 2001 statement [6][7][8]. We introduce here the result of that process, CONSORT 2010.
The CONSORT 2010 Statement is this paper including the 25 item checklist in the table (Table 1) and the flow diagram ( Figure 1). It provides guidance for reporting all randomised controlled trials, but focuses on the most common design type-individually randomised, two group, parallel trials. Other trial designs, such as cluster randomised trials and non-inferiority trials, require varying amounts of additional information. CONSORT extensions for these designs, [11,12] and other CON-SORT products, can be found through the CONSORT website http://www.consort-statement.org. Along with the CONSORT statement, we have updated the explanation and elaboration article, [13] which explains the inclusion of each checklist item, provides methodological background, and gives published examples of transparent reporting.
Diligent adherence by authors to the checklist items facilitates clarity, completeness, and transparency of reporting. Explicit descriptions, not ambiguity or omission, best serve the interests of all readers. Note that the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing, conducting, and analysing trials. It solely addresses the reporting of what was done and what was found.
Nevertheless, CONSORT does indirectly affect design and conduct. Transparent reporting reveals deficiencies in research if they exist. Thus, investigators who conduct inadequate trials, but who must transparently report, should not be able to pass through the publication process without revelation of their trial's inadequacies. That emerging reality should provide impetus to improved trial design and conduct in the future, a secondary indirect goal of our work. Moreover, CONSORT can help researchers in designing their trial.  Background to CONSORT Efforts to improve the reporting of randomised controlled trials accelerated in the mid-1990s, spurred partly by methodological research. Researchers had shown for many years that authors reported such trials poorly, and empirical evidence began to accumulate that some poorly conducted or poorly reported aspects of trials were associated with bias [14]. Two initiatives aimed at developing reporting guidelines culminated in one of us (DM) and Drummond Rennie organising the first CONSORT statement in 1996 [5]. Further methodological research on similar topics reinforced earlier findings [15] and fed into the revision of 2001 [6][7][8]. Subsequently, the expanding body of methodological research informed the refinement of CONSORT 2010. More than 700 studies com-prise the CONSORT database (located on the CONSORT website), which provides the empirical evidence to underpin the CONSORT initiative. Indeed, CONSORT Group members continually monitor the literature. Information gleaned from these efforts provides an evidence base on which to update the CON-SORT statement. We add, drop, or modify items based on that evidence and the recommendations of the CON-SORT Group, an international and eclectic group of clinical trialists, statisticians, epidemiologists, and biomedical editors. The CONSORT Executive (KFS, DGA, DM) strives for a balance of established and emerging researchers. The membership of the group is dynamic. As our work expands in response to emerging projects and needed expertise, we invite new members to contribute. Sources of funding and other support (such as supply of drugs), role of funders *We strongly recommend reading this statement in conjunction with the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13] for important clarifications on all the items. If relevant, we also recommend reading CONSORT extensions for cluster randomised trials [11], non-inferiority and equivalence trials [12], non-pharmacological treatments [32], herbal interventions [33], and pragmatic trials [34]. Additional extensions are forthcoming: for those and for up to date references relevant to this checklist, see http://www.consort-statement.org.
As such, CONSORT continually assimilates new ideas and perspectives. That process informs the continually evolving CONSORT statement. Over time, CONSORT has garnered much support. More than 400 journals, published around the world and in many languages, have explicitly supported the CON-SORT statement. Many other healthcare journals support it without our knowledge. Moreover, thousands more have implicitly supported it with the endorsement of the CONSORT statement by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors http://www.icmje.org. Other prominent editorial groups, the Council of Science Editors and the World Association of Medical Editors, officially support CONSORT. That support seems warranted: when used by authors and journals, CON-SORT seems to improve reporting [9].
Thirty one members of the CONSORT 2010 Group met in Montebello, Canada, in January 2007 to update the 2001 CONSORT statement. In addition to the accumulating evidence relating to existing checklist items, several new issues had come to prominence since 2001. Some participants were given primary responsibility for aggre-gating and synthesising the relevant evidence on a particular checklist item of interest. Based on that evidence, the group deliberated the value of each item. As in prior CONSORT versions, we kept only those items deemed absolutely fundamental to reporting a randomised controlled trial. Moreover, an item may be fundamental to a trial but not included, such as approval by an institutional ethical review board, because funding bodies strictly enforce ethical review and medical journals usually address reporting ethical review in their instructions for authors. Other items may seem desirable, such as reporting on whether on-site monitoring was done, but a lack of empirical evidence or any consensus on their value cautions against inclusion at this point. The CONSORT 2010 Statement thus addresses the minimum criteria, although that should not deter authors from including other information if they consider it important.
After the meeting, the CONSORT Executive convened teleconferences and meetings to revise the checklist. After seven major iterations, a revised checklist was distributed to the larger group for feedback. With that feedback, the executive met twice in person to consider all the comments and to produce a penultimate version. That served as the basis for writing the first draft of this paper, which was then distributed to the group for feedback. After consideration of their comments, the executive finalised the statement.
The CONSORT Executive then drafted an updated explanation and elaboration manuscript, with assistance from other members of the larger group. The substance of the 2007 CONSORT meeting provided the material for the update. The updated explanation and elaboration manuscript was distributed to the entire group for additions, deletions, and changes. That final iterative process converged to the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13].
The revision process resulted in evolutionary, not revolutionary, changes to the checklist (Table 1), and the flow diagram was not modified except for one word (Figure 1). Moreover, because other reporting guidelines augmenting the checklist refer to item numbers, we kept the existing items under their previous item numbers except for some renumbering of items 2 to 5. We added additional items either as a sub-item under an existing item, an entirely new item number at the end of the checklist, or (with item 3) an interjected item into a renumbered segment. We have summarised the noteworthy general changes in Appendix 1 and specific changes in Appendix 2. The CONSORT website contains a side by side comparison of the 2001 and 2010 versions.
We developed CONSORT 2010 to assist authors in writing reports of randomised controlled trials, editors and peer reviewers in reviewing manuscripts for publication, and readers in critically appraising published articles. The CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration provides elucidation and context to the checklist items. We strongly recommend using the explanation and elaboration in conjunction with the checklist to foster complete, clear, and transparent reporting and aid appraisal of published trial reports.
CONSORT 2010 focuses predominantly on the two group, parallel randomised controlled trial, which accounts for over half of trials in the literature [2]. Most of the items from the CONSORT 2010 Statement, however, pertain to all types of randomised trials. Nevertheless, some types of trials or trial situations dictate the need for additional information in the trial report. When in doubt, authors, editors, and readers should consult the CONSORT website for any CONSORT extensions, expansions (amplifications), implementations, or other guidance that may be relevant.
The evidence based approach we have used for CON-SORT also served as a model for development of other reporting guidelines, such as for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies evaluating interventions [16], diagnostic studies [17], and observational studies [18]. The explicit goal of all these initiatives is to improve reporting. The Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network will facilitate development of reporting guidelines and help disseminate the guidelines: http://www.equator-network.org provides information on all reporting guidelines in health research.
With CONSORT 2010, we again intentionally declined to produce a rigid structure for the reporting of randomised trials. Indeed, SORT [19] tried a rigid format, and it failed in a pilot run with an editor and authors [20]. Consequently, the format of articles should abide by journal style, editorial directions, the traditions of the research field addressed, and, where possible, author preferences. We do not wish to standardise the structure of reporting. Authors should simply address checklist items somewhere in the article, with ample detail and lucidity. That stated, we think that manuscripts benefit from frequent subheadings within the major sections, especially the methods and results sections.
CONSORT urges completeness, clarity, and transparency of reporting, which simply reflects the actual trial design and conduct. However, as a potential drawback, a reporting guideline might encourage some authors to report fictitiously the information suggested by the guidance rather than what was actually done. Authors, peer reviewers, and editors should vigilantly guard against that potential drawback and refer, for example, to trial protocols, to information on trial registers, and to regulatory agency websites. Moreover, the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing and conducting randomised trials. The items should elicit clear pronouncements of how and what the authors did, but do not contain any judgments on how and what the authors should have done. Thus, CONSORT 2010 is not intended as an instrument to evaluate the quality of a trial. Nor is it appropriate to use the checklist to construct a "quality score."
Nevertheless, we suggest that researchers begin trials with their end publication in mind. Poor reporting allows authors, intentionally or inadvertently, to escape scrutiny of any weak aspects of their trials. However, with wide adoption of CONSORT by journals and editorial groups, most authors should have to report transparently all important aspects of their trial. The ensuing scrutiny rewards well conducted trials and penalises poorly conducted trials. Thus, investigators should understand the CONSORT 2010 reporting guidelines before starting a trial as a further incentive to design and conduct their trials according to rigorous standards.
CONSORT 2010 supplants the prior version published in 2001. Any support for the earlier version accumulated from journals or editorial groups will automatically extend to this newer version, unless specifically requested otherwise. Journals that do not currently support CON-SORT may do so by registering on the CONSORT website. If a journal supports or endorses CONSORT 2010, it should cite one of the original versions of CONSORT 2010, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration, and the CONSORT website in their "Instructions to authors." We suggest that authors who wish to cite CON-SORT should cite this or another of the original journal versions of CONSORT 2010 Statement, and, if appropriate, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13]. All CONSORT material can be accessed through the original publishing journals or the CONSORT website. Groups or individuals who desire to translate the CON-SORT 2010 Statement into other languages should first consult the CONSORT policy statement on the website.
We emphasise that CONSORT 2010 represents an evolving guideline. It requires perpetual reappraisal and, if necessary, modifications. In the future we will further revise the CONSORT material considering comments, criticisms, experiences, and accumulating new evidence. We invite readers to submit recommendations via the CONSORT website.
• We simplified and clarified the wording, such as in items 1, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, and 21 • We improved consistency of style across the items by removing the imperative verbs that were in the 2001 version
• We enhanced specificity of appraisal by breaking some items into sub-items. Many journals expect authors to complete a CONSORT checklist indicating where in the manuscript the items have been addressed. Experience with the checklist noted pragmatic difficulties when an item comprised multiple elements. For example, item 4 addresses eligibility of participants and the settings and locations of data collection. With the 2001 version, an author could provide a page number for that item on the checklist, but might have reported only eligibility in the paper, for example, and not reported the settings and locations. CONSORT 2010 relieves obfuscations and forces authors to provide page numbers in the checklist for both eligibility and settings.
Item 1b (title and abstract)-We added a sub-item on providing a structured summary of trial design, methods, results, and conclusions and referenced the CONSORT for abstracts article [21].
Item 3a (trial design)-We added a new item including this sub-item to clarify the basic trial design (such as parallel group, crossover, cluster) and the allocation ratio Item 3b (trial design)-We added a new sub-item that addresses any important changes to methods after trial commencement, with a discussion of reasons
Item 5 (interventions)-Formerly item 4 in CONSORT 2001. We encouraged greater specificity by stating that descriptions of interventions should include "sufficient details to allow replication" [3] Item 6 (outcomes)-We added a sub-item on identifying any changes to the primary and secondary outcome (endpoint) measures after the trial started. This followed from empirical evidence that authors frequently provide analyses of outcomes in their published papers that were not the prespecified primary and secondary outcomes in their protocols, while ignoring their prespecified outcomes (that is, selective outcome reporting) [4,22]. We eliminated text on any methods used to enhance the quality of measurements Item 9 (allocation concealment mechanism)-We reworded this to include mechanism in both the report topic and the descriptor to reinforce that authors should report the actual steps taken to ensure allocation concealment rather than simply report imprecise, perhaps banal, assurances of concealment Item 11 (blinding)-We added the specification of how blinding was done and, if relevant, a description of the similarity of interventions and procedures. We also eliminated text on "how the success of blinding (masking) was assessed" because of a lack of empirical evidence supporting the practice as well as theoretical concerns about the validity of any such assessment [23,24] Item 12a (statistical methods)-We added that statistical methods should also be provided for analysis of secondary outcomes Sub-item 14b (recruitment)-Based on empirical research, we added a sub-item on "Why the trial ended or was stopped" [25] Item 15 (baseline data)-We specified "A table" to clarify that baseline and clinical characteristics of each group are most clearly expressed in a table Item 16 (numbers analysed)-We replaced mention of "intention to treat" analysis, a widely misused term, by a more explicit request for information about retaining participants in their original assigned groups [26] Sub-item 17b (outcomes and estimation)-For appropriate clinical interpretability, prevailing experience suggested the addition of "For binary outcomes, presentation of both relative and absolute effect sizes is recommended" [27] Item 19 (harms)-We included a reference to the CON-SORT paper on harms [28] Item 20 (limitations)-We changed the topic from "Interpretation" and supplanted the prior text with a sentence focusing on the reporting of sources of potential bias and imprecision Item 22 (interpretation)-We changed the topic from "Overall evidence." Indeed, we understand that authors should be allowed leeway for interpretation under this nebulous heading. However, the CONSORT Group expressed concerns that conclusions in papers frequently misrepresented the actual analytical results and that harms were ignored or marginalised. Therefore, we changed the checklist item to include the concepts of results matching interpretations and of benefits being balanced with harms Item 23 (registration)-We added a new item on trial registration. Empirical evidence supports the need for trial registration, and recent requirements by journal editors have fostered compliance [29] Item 24 (protocol)-We added a new item on availability of the trial protocol. Empirical evidence suggests that authors often ignore, in the conduct and reporting of their trial, what they stated in the protocol [4,22]. Hence, availability of the protocol can instigate adherence to the protocol before publication and facilitate assessment of adherence after publication Item 25 (funding)-We added a new item on funding. Empirical evidence points toward funding source sometimes being associated with estimatedeatment effects [30] Competing interests Uniform disclosure of potential conflicts of interest: all authors have completed the ICMJE unified competing interest form at http://www.icmje.org/ coi_disclosure.pdf (available from the corresponding author) and declare (1) DM received grants for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; KFS and DGA received support for travel to meetings for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; (2) KFS and DA had travel expenses reimbursed by the EQUATOR Network; KFS has received honoraria for delivering educational presentations for the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology Foundation for Excellence in Women's Health Care, Ortho-McNeil Janssen Scientific Affairs, and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology; and has done consultancy for Wyeth.

Thus, investigators should understand the CONSORT 2010 reporting guidelines before starting a trial as a further incentive to design and conduct their trials according to rigorous standards.
CONSORT 2010 supplants the prior version published in 2001. Any support for the earlier version accumulated from journals or editorial groups will automatically extend to this newer version, unless specifically requested otherwise. Journals that do not currently support CON-SORT may do so by registering on the CONSORT website. If a journal supports or endorses CONSORT 2010, it should cite one of the original versions of CONSORT 2010, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration, and the CONSORT website in their "Instructions to authors." We suggest that authors who wish to cite CON-SORT should cite this or another of the original journal versions of CONSORT 2010 Statement, and, if appropriate, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13]. All CONSORT material can be accessed through the original publishing journals or the CONSORT website. Groups or individuals who desire to translate the CON-SORT 2010 Statement into other languages should first consult the CONSORT policy statement on the website.
We emphasise that CONSORT 2010 represents an evolving guideline. It requires perpetual reappraisal and, if necessary, modifications. In the future we will further revise the CONSORT material considering comments, criticisms, experiences, and accumulating new evidence. We invite readers to submit recommendations via the CONSORT website.
• We simplified and clarified the wording, such as in items 1, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, and 21 • We improved consistency of style across the items by removing the imperative verbs that were in the 2001 version
• We enhanced specificity of appraisal by breaking some items into sub-items. Many journals expect authors to complete a CONSORT checklist indicating where in the manuscript the items have been addressed. Experience with the checklist noted pragmatic difficulties when an item comprised multiple elements. For example, item 4 addresses eligibility of participants and the settings and locations of data collection. With the 2001 version, an author could provide a page number for that item on the checklist, but might have reported only eligibility in the paper, for example, and not reported the settings and locations. CONSORT 2010 relieves obfuscations and forces authors to provide page numbers in the checklist for both eligibility and settings.
Item 1b (title and abstract)-We added a sub-item on providing a structured summary of trial design, methods, results, and conclusions and referenced the CONSORT for abstracts article [21].
Item 3a (trial design)-We added a new item including this sub-item to clarify the basic trial design (such as parallel group, crossover, cluster) and the allocation ratio Item 3b (trial design)-We added a new sub-item that addresses any important changes to methods after trial commencement, with a discussion of reasons
Item 5 (interventions)-Formerly item 4 in CONSORT 2001. We encouraged greater specificity by stating that descriptions of interventions should include "sufficient details to allow replication" [3] Item 6 (outcomes)-We added a sub-item on identifying any changes to the primary and secondary outcome (endpoint) measures after the trial started. This followed from empirical evidence that authors frequently provide analyses of outcomes in their published papers that were not the prespecified primary and secondary outcomes in their protocols, while ignoring their prespecified outcomes (that is, selective outcome reporting) [4,22]. We eliminated text on any methods used to enhance the quality of measurements Item 9 (allocation concealment mechanism)-We reworded this to include mechanism in both the report topic and the descriptor to reinforce that authors should report the actual steps taken to ensure allocation concealment rather than simply report imprecise, perhaps banal, assurances of concealment Item 11 (blinding)-We added the specification of how blinding was done and, if relevant, a description of the similarity of interventions and procedures. We also eliminated text on "how the success of blinding (masking) was assessed" because of a lack of empirical evidence supporting the practice as well as theoretical concerns about the validity of any such assessment [23,24] Item 12a (statistical methods)-We added that statistical methods should also be provided for analysis of secondary outcomes Sub-item 14b (recruitment)-Based on empirical research, we added a sub-item on "Why the trial ended or was stopped" [25] Item 15 (baseline data)-We specified "A table" to clarify that baseline and clinical characteristics of each group are most clearly expressed in a table Item 16 (numbers analysed)-We replaced mention of "intention to treat" analysis, a widely misused term, by a more explicit request for information about retaining participants in their original assigned groups [26] Sub-item 17b (outcomes and estimation)-For appropriate clinical interpretability, prevailing experience suggested the addition of "For binary outcomes, presentation of both relative and absolute effect sizes is recommended" [27] Item 19 (harms)-We included a reference to the CON-SORT paper on harms [28] Item 20 (limitations)-We changed the topic from "Interpretation" and supplanted the prior text with a sentence focusing on the reporting of sources of potential bias and imprecision Item 22 (interpretation)-We changed the topic from "Overall evidence." Indeed, we understand that authors should be allowed leeway for interpretation under this nebulous heading. However, the CONSORT Group expressed concerns that conclusions in papers frequently misrepresented the actual analytical results and that harms were ignored or marginalised. Therefore, we changed the checklist item to include the concepts of results matching interpretations and of benefits being balanced with harms Item 23 (registration)-We added a new item on trial registration. Empirical evidence supports the need for trial registration, and recent requirements by journal editors have fostered compliance [29] Item 24 (protocol)-We added a new item on availability of the trial protocol. Empirical evidence suggests that authors often ignore, in the conduct and reporting of their trial, what they stated in the protocol [4,22]. Hence, availability of the protocol can instigate adherence to the protocol before publication and facilitate assessment of adherence after publication Item 25 (funding)-We added a new item on funding. Empirical evidence points toward funding source sometimes being associated with estimatedeatment effects [30] Competing interests Uniform disclosure of potential conflicts of interest: all authors have completed the ICMJE unified competing interest form at http://www.icmje.org/ coi_disclosure.pdf (available from the corresponding author) and declare (1) DM received grants for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; KFS and DGA received support for travel to meetings for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; (2) KFS and DA had travel expenses reimbursed by the EQUATOR Network; KFS has received honoraria for delivering educational presentations for the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology Foundation for Excellence in Women's Health Care, Ortho-McNeil Janssen Scientific Affairs, and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology; and has done consultancy for Wyeth.

Authors' contributions KFS, DM, and DGA participated in meetings and regular conference calls, planned the CONSORT 2007 meeting at Montebello, developed the agenda, prepared background research, identified and invited participants, contributed to the CONSORT meeting, drafted the manuscript, and, after critical review by the CONSORT Group, finalised the text of the manuscript. Members of the CONSORT Group attended the meeting, except for those noted below, and provided input on and review of the revised checklist and text of this article. Some members also prepared background material.
Randomised controlled trials, when appropriately designed, conducted, and reported, represent the gold standard in evaluating healthcare interventions. However, randomised trials can yield biased results if they lack methodological rigour [1]. To assess a trial accurately, readers of a published report need complete, clear, and transparent information on its methodology and findings. Unfortunately, attempted assessments frequently fail because authors of many trial reports neglect to provide lucid and complete descriptions of that critical information [2][3][4].
That lack of adequate reporting fuelled the development of the original CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement in 1996 [5] and its revision five years later [6][7][8]. While those statements improved the reporting quality for some randomised controlled trials, [9,10] many trial reports still remain inadequate [2]. Furthermore, new methodological evidence and additional experience has accumulated since the last revision in 2001. Consequently, we organised a CONSORT Group meeting to update the 2001 statement [6][7][8]. We introduce here the result of that process, CONSORT 2010.
The CONSORT 2010 Statement is this paper including the 25 item checklist in the table (Table 1) and the flow diagram ( Figure 1). It provides guidance for reporting all randomised controlled trials, but focuses on the most common design type-individually randomised, two group, parallel trials. Other trial designs, such as cluster randomised trials and non-inferiority trials, require varying amounts of additional information. CONSORT extensions for these designs, [11,12] and other CON-SORT products, can be found through the CONSORT website http://www.consort-statement.org. Along with the CONSORT statement, we have updated the explanation and elaboration article, [13] which explains the inclusion of each checklist item, provides methodological background, and gives published examples of transparent reporting.
Diligent adherence by authors to the checklist items facilitates clarity, completeness, and transparency of reporting. Explicit descriptions, not ambiguity or omission, best serve the interests of all readers. Note that the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing, conducting, and analysing trials. It solely addresses the reporting of what was done and what was found.
Nevertheless, CONSORT does indirectly affect design and conduct. Transparent reporting reveals deficiencies in research if they exist. Thus, investigators who conduct inadequate trials, but who must transparently report, should not be able to pass through the publication process without revelation of their trial's inadequacies. That emerging reality should provide impetus to improved trial design and conduct in the future, a secondary indirect goal of our work. Moreover, CONSORT can help researchers in designing their trial.  Background to CONSORT Efforts to improve the reporting of randomised controlled trials accelerated in the mid-1990s, spurred partly by methodological research. Researchers had shown for many years that authors reported such trials poorly, and empirical evidence began to accumulate that some poorly conducted or poorly reported aspects of trials were associated with bias [14]. Two initiatives aimed at developing reporting guidelines culminated in one of us (DM) and Drummond Rennie organising the first CONSORT statement in 1996 [5]. Further methodological research on similar topics reinforced earlier findings [15] and fed into the revision of 2001 [6][7][8]. Subsequently, the expanding body of methodological research informed the refinement of CONSORT 2010. More than 700 studies com-prise the CONSORT database (located on the CONSORT website), which provides the empirical evidence to underpin the CONSORT initiative. Indeed, CONSORT Group members continually monitor the literature. Information gleaned from these efforts provides an evidence base on which to update the CON-SORT statement. We add, drop, or modify items based on that evidence and the recommendations of the CON-SORT Group, an international and eclectic group of clinical trialists, statisticians, epidemiologists, and biomedical editors. The CONSORT Executive (KFS, DGA, DM) strives for a balance of established and emerging researchers. The membership of the group is dynamic. As our work expands in response to emerging projects and needed expertise, we invite new members to contribute. Sources of funding and other support (such as supply of drugs), role of funders *We strongly recommend reading this statement in conjunction with the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13] for important clarifications on all the items. If relevant, we also recommend reading CONSORT extensions for cluster randomised trials [11], non-inferiority and equivalence trials [12], non-pharmacological treatments [32], herbal interventions [33], and pragmatic trials [34]. Additional extensions are forthcoming: for those and for up to date references relevant to this checklist, see http://www.consort-statement.org.
As such, CONSORT continually assimilates new ideas and perspectives. That process informs the continually evolving CONSORT statement. Over time, CONSORT has garnered much support. More than 400 journals, published around the world and in many languages, have explicitly supported the CON-SORT statement. Many other healthcare journals support it without our knowledge. Moreover, thousands more have implicitly supported it with the endorsement of the CONSORT statement by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors http://www.icmje.org. Other prominent editorial groups, the Council of Science Editors and the World Association of Medical Editors, officially support CONSORT. That support seems warranted: when used by authors and journals, CON-SORT seems to improve reporting [9].
Thirty one members of the CONSORT 2010 Group met in Montebello, Canada, in January 2007 to update the 2001 CONSORT statement. In addition to the accumulating evidence relating to existing checklist items, several new issues had come to prominence since 2001. Some participants were given primary responsibility for aggre-gating and synthesising the relevant evidence on a particular checklist item of interest. Based on that evidence, the group deliberated the value of each item. As in prior CONSORT versions, we kept only those items deemed absolutely fundamental to reporting a randomised controlled trial. Moreover, an item may be fundamental to a trial but not included, such as approval by an institutional ethical review board, because funding bodies strictly enforce ethical review and medical journals usually address reporting ethical review in their instructions for authors. Other items may seem desirable, such as reporting on whether on-site monitoring was done, but a lack of empirical evidence or any consensus on their value cautions against inclusion at this point. The CONSORT 2010 Statement thus addresses the minimum criteria, although that should not deter authors from including other information if they consider it important.
After the meeting, the CONSORT Executive convened teleconferences and meetings to revise the checklist. After seven major iterations, a revised checklist was distributed to the larger group for feedback. With that feedback, the executive met twice in person to consider all the comments and to produce a penultimate version. That served as the basis for writing the first draft of this paper, which was then distributed to the group for feedback. After consideration of their comments, the executive finalised the statement.
The CONSORT Executive then drafted an updated explanation and elaboration manuscript, with assistance from other members of the larger group. The substance of the 2007 CONSORT meeting provided the material for the update. The updated explanation and elaboration manuscript was distributed to the entire group for additions, deletions, and changes. That final iterative process converged to the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13].
The revision process resulted in evolutionary, not revolutionary, changes to the checklist (Table 1), and the flow diagram was not modified except for one word (Figure 1). Moreover, because other reporting guidelines augmenting the checklist refer to item numbers, we kept the existing items under their previous item numbers except for some renumbering of items 2 to 5. We added additional items either as a sub-item under an existing item, an entirely new item number at the end of the checklist, or (with item 3) an interjected item into a renumbered segment. We have summarised the noteworthy general changes in Appendix 1 and specific changes in Appendix 2. The CONSORT website contains a side by side comparison of the 2001 and 2010 versions.
We developed CONSORT 2010 to assist authors in writing reports of randomised controlled trials, editors and peer reviewers in reviewing manuscripts for publication, and readers in critically appraising published articles. The CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration provides elucidation and context to the checklist items. We strongly recommend using the explanation and elaboration in conjunction with the checklist to foster complete, clear, and transparent reporting and aid appraisal of published trial reports.
CONSORT 2010 focuses predominantly on the two group, parallel randomised controlled trial, which accounts for over half of trials in the literature [2]. Most of the items from the CONSORT 2010 Statement, however, pertain to all types of randomised trials. Nevertheless, some types of trials or trial situations dictate the need for additional information in the trial report. When in doubt, authors, editors, and readers should consult the CONSORT website for any CONSORT extensions, expansions (amplifications), implementations, or other guidance that may be relevant.
The evidence based approach we have used for CON-SORT also served as a model for development of other reporting guidelines, such as for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies evaluating interventions [16], diagnostic studies [17], and observational studies [18]. The explicit goal of all these initiatives is to improve reporting. The Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network will facilitate development of reporting guidelines and help disseminate the guidelines: http://www.equator-network.org provides information on all reporting guidelines in health research.
With CONSORT 2010, we again intentionally declined to produce a rigid structure for the reporting of randomised trials. Indeed, SORT [19] tried a rigid format, and it failed in a pilot run with an editor and authors [20]. Consequently, the format of articles should abide by journal style, editorial directions, the traditions of the research field addressed, and, where possible, author preferences. We do not wish to standardise the structure of reporting. Authors should simply address checklist items somewhere in the article, with ample detail and lucidity. That stated, we think that manuscripts benefit from frequent subheadings within the major sections, especially the methods and results sections.
CONSORT urges completeness, clarity, and transparency of reporting, which simply reflects the actual trial design and conduct. However, as a potential drawback, a reporting guideline might encourage some authors to report fictitiously the information suggested by the guidance rather than what was actually done. Authors, peer reviewers, and editors should vigilantly guard against that potential drawback and refer, for example, to trial protocols, to information on trial registers, and to regulatory agency websites. Moreover, the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing and conducting randomised trials. The items should elicit clear pronouncements of how and what the authors did, but do not contain any judgments on how and what the authors should have done. Thus, CONSORT 2010 is not intended as an instrument to evaluate the quality of a trial. Nor is it appropriate to use the checklist to construct a "quality score."
Nevertheless, we suggest that researchers begin trials with their end publication in mind. Poor reporting allows authors, intentionally or inadvertently, to escape scrutiny of any weak aspects of their trials. However, with wide adoption of CONSORT by journals and editorial groups, most authors should have to report transparently all important aspects of their trial. The ensuing scrutiny rewards well conducted trials and penalises poorly conducted trials. Thus, investigators should understand the CONSORT 2010 reporting guidelines before starting a trial as a further incentive to design and conduct their trials according to rigorous standards.
CONSORT 2010 supplants the prior version published in 2001. Any support for the earlier version accumulated from journals or editorial groups will automatically extend to this newer version, unless specifically requested otherwise. Journals that do not currently support CON-SORT may do so by registering on the CONSORT website. If a journal supports or endorses CONSORT 2010, it should cite one of the original versions of CONSORT 2010, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration, and the CONSORT website in their "Instructions to authors." We suggest that authors who wish to cite CON-SORT should cite this or another of the original journal versions of CONSORT 2010 Statement, and, if appropriate, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13]. All CONSORT material can be accessed through the original publishing journals or the CONSORT website. Groups or individuals who desire to translate the CON-SORT 2010 Statement into other languages should first consult the CONSORT policy statement on the website.
We emphasise that CONSORT 2010 represents an evolving guideline. It requires perpetual reappraisal and, if necessary, modifications. In the future we will further revise the CONSORT material considering comments, criticisms, experiences, and accumulating new evidence. We invite readers to submit recommendations via the CONSORT website.

CONSORT 2010 focuses predominantly on the two group, parallel randomised controlled trial, which accounts for over half of trials in the literature [2]. Most of the items from the CONSORT 2010 Statement, however, pertain to all types of randomised trials. Nevertheless, some types of trials or trial situations dictate the need for additional information in the trial report. When in doubt, authors, editors, and readers should consult the CONSORT website for any CONSORT extensions, expansions (amplifications), implementations, or other guidance that may be relevant.
The evidence based approach we have used for CON-SORT also served as a model for development of other reporting guidelines, such as for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies evaluating interventions [16], diagnostic studies [17], and observational studies [18]. The explicit goal of all these initiatives is to improve reporting. The Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network will facilitate development of reporting guidelines and help disseminate the guidelines: http://www.equator-network.org provides information on all reporting guidelines in health research.
With CONSORT 2010, we again intentionally declined to produce a rigid structure for the reporting of randomised trials. Indeed, SORT [19] tried a rigid format, and it failed in a pilot run with an editor and authors [20]. Consequently, the format of articles should abide by journal style, editorial directions, the traditions of the research field addressed, and, where possible, author preferences. We do not wish to standardise the structure of reporting. Authors should simply address checklist items somewhere in the article, with ample detail and lucidity. That stated, we think that manuscripts benefit from frequent subheadings within the major sections, especially the methods and results sections.
CONSORT urges completeness, clarity, and transparency of reporting, which simply reflects the actual trial design and conduct. However, as a potential drawback, a reporting guideline might encourage some authors to report fictitiously the information suggested by the guidance rather than what was actually done. Authors, peer reviewers, and editors should vigilantly guard against that potential drawback and refer, for example, to trial protocols, to information on trial registers, and to regulatory agency websites. Moreover, the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing and conducting randomised trials. The items should elicit clear pronouncements of how and what the authors did, but do not contain any judgments on how and what the authors should have done. Thus, CONSORT 2010 is not intended as an instrument to evaluate the quality of a trial. Nor is it appropriate to use the checklist to construct a "quality score."
Nevertheless, we suggest that researchers begin trials with their end publication in mind. Poor reporting allows authors, intentionally or inadvertently, to escape scrutiny of any weak aspects of their trials. However, with wide adoption of CONSORT by journals and editorial groups, most authors should have to report transparently all important aspects of their trial. The ensuing scrutiny rewards well conducted trials and penalises poorly conducted trials. Thus, investigators should understand the CONSORT 2010 reporting guidelines before starting a trial as a further incentive to design and conduct their trials according to rigorous standards.
CONSORT 2010 supplants the prior version published in 2001. Any support for the earlier version accumulated from journals or editorial groups will automatically extend to this newer version, unless specifically requested otherwise. Journals that do not currently support CON-SORT may do so by registering on the CONSORT website. If a journal supports or endorses CONSORT 2010, it should cite one of the original versions of CONSORT 2010, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration, and the CONSORT website in their "Instructions to authors." We suggest that authors who wish to cite CON-SORT should cite this or another of the original journal versions of CONSORT 2010 Statement, and, if appropriate, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13]. All CONSORT material can be accessed through the original publishing journals or the CONSORT website. Groups or individuals who desire to translate the CON-SORT 2010 Statement into other languages should first consult the CONSORT policy statement on the website.
We emphasise that CONSORT 2010 represents an evolving guideline. It requires perpetual reappraisal and, if necessary, modifications. In the future we will further revise the CONSORT material considering comments, criticisms, experiences, and accumulating new evidence. We invite readers to submit recommendations via the CONSORT website.
• We simplified and clarified the wording, such as in items 1, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, and 21 • We improved consistency of style across the items by removing the imperative verbs that were in the 2001 version
• We enhanced specificity of appraisal by breaking some items into sub-items. Many journals expect authors to complete a CONSORT checklist indicating where in the manuscript the items have been addressed. Experience with the checklist noted pragmatic difficulties when an item comprised multiple elements. For example, item 4 addresses eligibility of participants and the settings and locations of data collection. With the 2001 version, an author could provide a page number for that item on the checklist, but might have reported only eligibility in the paper, for example, and not reported the settings and locations. CONSORT 2010 relieves obfuscations and forces authors to provide page numbers in the checklist for both eligibility and settings.
Item 1b (title and abstract)-We added a sub-item on providing a structured summary of trial design, methods, results, and conclusions and referenced the CONSORT for abstracts article [21].
Item 3a (trial design)-We added a new item including this sub-item to clarify the basic trial design (such as parallel group, crossover, cluster) and the allocation ratio Item 3b (trial design)-We added a new sub-item that addresses any important changes to methods after trial commencement, with a discussion of reasons
Item 5 (interventions)-Formerly item 4 in CONSORT 2001. We encouraged greater specificity by stating that descriptions of interventions should include "sufficient details to allow replication" [3] Item 6 (outcomes)-We added a sub-item on identifying any changes to the primary and secondary outcome (endpoint) measures after the trial started. This followed from empirical evidence that authors frequently provide analyses of outcomes in their published papers that were not the prespecified primary and secondary outcomes in their protocols, while ignoring their prespecified outcomes (that is, selective outcome reporting) [4,22]. We eliminated text on any methods used to enhance the quality of measurements Item 9 (allocation concealment mechanism)-We reworded this to include mechanism in both the report topic and the descriptor to reinforce that authors should report the actual steps taken to ensure allocation concealment rather than simply report imprecise, perhaps banal, assurances of concealment Item 11 (blinding)-We added the specification of how blinding was done and, if relevant, a description of the similarity of interventions and procedures. We also eliminated text on "how the success of blinding (masking) was assessed" because of a lack of empirical evidence supporting the practice as well as theoretical concerns about the validity of any such assessment [23,24] Item 12a (statistical methods)-We added that statistical methods should also be provided for analysis of secondary outcomes Sub-item 14b (recruitment)-Based on empirical research, we added a sub-item on "Why the trial ended or was stopped" [25] Item 15 (baseline data)-We specified "A table" to clarify that baseline and clinical characteristics of each group are most clearly expressed in a table Item 16 (numbers analysed)-We replaced mention of "intention to treat" analysis, a widely misused term, by a more explicit request for information about retaining participants in their original assigned groups [26] Sub-item 17b (outcomes and estimation)-For appropriate clinical interpretability, prevailing experience suggested the addition of "For binary outcomes, presentation of both relative and absolute effect sizes is recommended" [27] Item 19 (harms)-We included a reference to the CON-SORT paper on harms [28] Item 20 (limitations)-We changed the topic from "Interpretation" and supplanted the prior text with a sentence focusing on the reporting of sources of potential bias and imprecision Item 22 (interpretation)-We changed the topic from "Overall evidence." Indeed, we understand that authors should be allowed leeway for interpretation under this nebulous heading. However, the CONSORT Group expressed concerns that conclusions in papers frequently misrepresented the actual analytical results and that harms were ignored or marginalised. Therefore, we changed the checklist item to include the concepts of results matching interpretations and of benefits being balanced with harms Item 23 (registration)-We added a new item on trial registration. Empirical evidence supports the need for trial registration, and recent requirements by journal editors have fostered compliance [29] Item 24 (protocol)-We added a new item on availability of the trial protocol. Empirical evidence suggests that authors often ignore, in the conduct and reporting of their trial, what they stated in the protocol [4,22]. Hence, availability of the protocol can instigate adherence to the protocol before publication and facilitate assessment of adherence after publication Item 25 (funding)-We added a new item on funding. Empirical evidence points toward funding source sometimes being associated with estimatedeatment effects [30] Competing interests Uniform disclosure of potential conflicts of interest: all authors have completed the ICMJE unified competing interest form at http://www.icmje.org/ coi_disclosure.pdf (available from the corresponding author) and declare (1) DM received grants for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; KFS and DGA received support for travel to meetings for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; (2) KFS and DA had travel expenses reimbursed by the EQUATOR Network; KFS has received honoraria for delivering educational presentations for the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology Foundation for Excellence in Women's Health Care, Ortho-McNeil Janssen Scientific Affairs, and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology; and has done consultancy for Wyeth.

Authors' contributions KFS, DM, and DGA participated in meetings and regular conference calls, planned the CONSORT 2007 meeting at Montebello, developed the agenda, prepared background research, identified and invited participants, contributed to the CONSORT meeting, drafted the manuscript, and, after critical review by the CONSORT Group, finalised the text of the manuscript. Members of the CONSORT Group attended the meeting, except for those noted below, and provided input on and review of the revised checklist and text of this article. Some members also prepared background material.
Randomised controlled trials, when appropriately designed, conducted, and reported, represent the gold standard in evaluating healthcare interventions. However, randomised trials can yield biased results if they lack methodological rigour [1]. To assess a trial accurately, readers of a published report need complete, clear, and transparent information on its methodology and findings. Unfortunately, attempted assessments frequently fail because authors of many trial reports neglect to provide lucid and complete descriptions of that critical information [2][3][4].
That lack of adequate reporting fuelled the development of the original CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement in 1996 [5] and its revision five years later [6][7][8]. While those statements improved the reporting quality for some randomised controlled trials, [9,10] many trial reports still remain inadequate [2]. Furthermore, new methodological evidence and additional experience has accumulated since the last revision in 2001. Consequently, we organised a CONSORT Group meeting to update the 2001 statement [6][7][8]. We introduce here the result of that process, CONSORT 2010.
The CONSORT 2010 Statement is this paper including the 25 item checklist in the table (Table 1) and the flow diagram ( Figure 1). It provides guidance for reporting all randomised controlled trials, but focuses on the most common design type-individually randomised, two group, parallel trials. Other trial designs, such as cluster randomised trials and non-inferiority trials, require varying amounts of additional information. CONSORT extensions for these designs, [11,12] and other CON-SORT products, can be found through the CONSORT website http://www.consort-statement.org. Along with the CONSORT statement, we have updated the explanation and elaboration article, [13] which explains the inclusion of each checklist item, provides methodological background, and gives published examples of transparent reporting.
Diligent adherence by authors to the checklist items facilitates clarity, completeness, and transparency of reporting. Explicit descriptions, not ambiguity or omission, best serve the interests of all readers. Note that the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing, conducting, and analysing trials. It solely addresses the reporting of what was done and what was found.
Nevertheless, CONSORT does indirectly affect design and conduct. Transparent reporting reveals deficiencies in research if they exist. Thus, investigators who conduct inadequate trials, but who must transparently report, should not be able to pass through the publication process without revelation of their trial's inadequacies. That emerging reality should provide impetus to improved trial design and conduct in the future, a secondary indirect goal of our work. Moreover, CONSORT can help researchers in designing their trial.  Background to CONSORT Efforts to improve the reporting of randomised controlled trials accelerated in the mid-1990s, spurred partly by methodological research. Researchers had shown for many years that authors reported such trials poorly, and empirical evidence began to accumulate that some poorly conducted or poorly reported aspects of trials were associated with bias [14]. Two initiatives aimed at developing reporting guidelines culminated in one of us (DM) and Drummond Rennie organising the first CONSORT statement in 1996 [5]. Further methodological research on similar topics reinforced earlier findings [15] and fed into the revision of 2001 [6][7][8]. Subsequently, the expanding body of methodological research informed the refinement of CONSORT 2010. More than 700 studies com-prise the CONSORT database (located on the CONSORT website), which provides the empirical evidence to underpin the CONSORT initiative. Indeed, CONSORT Group members continually monitor the literature. Information gleaned from these efforts provides an evidence base on which to update the CON-SORT statement. We add, drop, or modify items based on that evidence and the recommendations of the CON-SORT Group, an international and eclectic group of clinical trialists, statisticians, epidemiologists, and biomedical editors. The CONSORT Executive (KFS, DGA, DM) strives for a balance of established and emerging researchers. The membership of the group is dynamic. As our work expands in response to emerging projects and needed expertise, we invite new members to contribute. Sources of funding and other support (such as supply of drugs), role of funders *We strongly recommend reading this statement in conjunction with the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13] for important clarifications on all the items. If relevant, we also recommend reading CONSORT extensions for cluster randomised trials [11], non-inferiority and equivalence trials [12], non-pharmacological treatments [32], herbal interventions [33], and pragmatic trials [34]. Additional extensions are forthcoming: for those and for up to date references relevant to this checklist, see http://www.consort-statement.org.
As such, CONSORT continually assimilates new ideas and perspectives. That process informs the continually evolving CONSORT statement. Over time, CONSORT has garnered much support. More than 400 journals, published around the world and in many languages, have explicitly supported the CON-SORT statement. Many other healthcare journals support it without our knowledge. Moreover, thousands more have implicitly supported it with the endorsement of the CONSORT statement by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors http://www.icmje.org. Other prominent editorial groups, the Council of Science Editors and the World Association of Medical Editors, officially support CONSORT. That support seems warranted: when used by authors and journals, CON-SORT seems to improve reporting [9].
Thirty one members of the CONSORT 2010 Group met in Montebello, Canada, in January 2007 to update the 2001 CONSORT statement. In addition to the accumulating evidence relating to existing checklist items, several new issues had come to prominence since 2001. Some participants were given primary responsibility for aggre-gating and synthesising the relevant evidence on a particular checklist item of interest. Based on that evidence, the group deliberated the value of each item. As in prior CONSORT versions, we kept only those items deemed absolutely fundamental to reporting a randomised controlled trial. Moreover, an item may be fundamental to a trial but not included, such as approval by an institutional ethical review board, because funding bodies strictly enforce ethical review and medical journals usually address reporting ethical review in their instructions for authors. Other items may seem desirable, such as reporting on whether on-site monitoring was done, but a lack of empirical evidence or any consensus on their value cautions against inclusion at this point. The CONSORT 2010 Statement thus addresses the minimum criteria, although that should not deter authors from including other information if they consider it important.
After the meeting, the CONSORT Executive convened teleconferences and meetings to revise the checklist. After seven major iterations, a revised checklist was distributed to the larger group for feedback. With that feedback, the executive met twice in person to consider all the comments and to produce a penultimate version. That served as the basis for writing the first draft of this paper, which was then distributed to the group for feedback. After consideration of their comments, the executive finalised the statement.
The CONSORT Executive then drafted an updated explanation and elaboration manuscript, with assistance from other members of the larger group. The substance of the 2007 CONSORT meeting provided the material for the update. The updated explanation and elaboration manuscript was distributed to the entire group for additions, deletions, and changes. That final iterative process converged to the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13].
The revision process resulted in evolutionary, not revolutionary, changes to the checklist (Table 1), and the flow diagram was not modified except for one word (Figure 1). Moreover, because other reporting guidelines augmenting the checklist refer to item numbers, we kept the existing items under their previous item numbers except for some renumbering of items 2 to 5. We added additional items either as a sub-item under an existing item, an entirely new item number at the end of the checklist, or (with item 3) an interjected item into a renumbered segment. We have summarised the noteworthy general changes in Appendix 1 and specific changes in Appendix 2. The CONSORT website contains a side by side comparison of the 2001 and 2010 versions.
We developed CONSORT 2010 to assist authors in writing reports of randomised controlled trials, editors and peer reviewers in reviewing manuscripts for publication, and readers in critically appraising published articles. The CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration provides elucidation and context to the checklist items. We strongly recommend using the explanation and elaboration in conjunction with the checklist to foster complete, clear, and transparent reporting and aid appraisal of published trial reports.
CONSORT 2010 focuses predominantly on the two group, parallel randomised controlled trial, which accounts for over half of trials in the literature [2]. Most of the items from the CONSORT 2010 Statement, however, pertain to all types of randomised trials. Nevertheless, some types of trials or trial situations dictate the need for additional information in the trial report. When in doubt, authors, editors, and readers should consult the CONSORT website for any CONSORT extensions, expansions (amplifications), implementations, or other guidance that may be relevant.
The evidence based approach we have used for CON-SORT also served as a model for development of other reporting guidelines, such as for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies evaluating interventions [16], diagnostic studies [17], and observational studies [18]. The explicit goal of all these initiatives is to improve reporting. The Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network will facilitate development of reporting guidelines and help disseminate the guidelines: http://www.equator-network.org provides information on all reporting guidelines in health research.
With CONSORT 2010, we again intentionally declined to produce a rigid structure for the reporting of randomised trials. Indeed, SORT [19] tried a rigid format, and it failed in a pilot run with an editor and authors [20]. Consequently, the format of articles should abide by journal style, editorial directions, the traditions of the research field addressed, and, where possible, author preferences. We do not wish to standardise the structure of reporting. Authors should simply address checklist items somewhere in the article, with ample detail and lucidity. That stated, we think that manuscripts benefit from frequent subheadings within the major sections, especially the methods and results sections.

Moreover, the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing and conducting randomised trials. The items should elicit clear pronouncements of how and what the authors did, but do not contain any judgments on how and what the authors should have done. Thus, CONSORT 2010 is not intended as an instrument to evaluate the quality of a trial. Nor is it appropriate to use the checklist to construct a "quality score."

Introduction

Randomised controlled trials, when appropriately designed, conducted, and reported, represent the gold standard in evaluating healthcare interventions. However, randomised trials can yield biased results if they lack methodological rigour [1]. To assess a trial accurately, readers of a published report need complete, clear, and transparent information on its methodology and findings. Unfortunately, attempted assessments frequently fail because authors of many trial reports neglect to provide lucid and complete descriptions of that critical information [2][3][4].
That lack of adequate reporting fuelled the development of the original CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement in 1996 [5] and its revision five years later [6][7][8]. While those statements improved the reporting quality for some randomised controlled trials, [9,10] many trial reports still remain inadequate [2]. Furthermore, new methodological evidence and additional experience has accumulated since the last revision in 2001. Consequently, we organised a CONSORT Group meeting to update the 2001 statement [6][7][8]. We introduce here the result of that process, CONSORT 2010.

Intent of CONSORT 2010

The CONSORT 2010 Statement is this paper including the 25 item checklist in the table (Table 1) and the flow diagram ( Figure 1). It provides guidance for reporting all randomised controlled trials, but focuses on the most common design type-individually randomised, two group, parallel trials. Other trial designs, such as cluster randomised trials and non-inferiority trials, require varying amounts of additional information. CONSORT extensions for these designs, [11,12] and other CON-SORT products, can be found through the CONSORT website http://www.consort-statement.org. Along with the CONSORT statement, we have updated the explanation and elaboration article, [13] which explains the inclusion of each checklist item, provides methodological background, and gives published examples of transparent reporting.
Diligent adherence by authors to the checklist items facilitates clarity, completeness, and transparency of reporting. Explicit descriptions, not ambiguity or omission, best serve the interests of all readers. Note that the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing, conducting, and analysing trials. It solely addresses the reporting of what was done and what was found.
Nevertheless, CONSORT does indirectly affect design and conduct. Transparent reporting reveals deficiencies in research if they exist. Thus, investigators who conduct inadequate trials, but who must transparently report, should not be able to pass through the publication process without revelation of their trial's inadequacies. That emerging reality should provide impetus to improved trial design and conduct in the future, a secondary indirect goal of our work. Moreover, CONSORT can help researchers in designing their trial.

If relevant, we also recommend reading CONSORT extensions for cluster randomised trials [11], non-inferiority and equivalence trials [12], non-pharmacological treatments [32], herbal interventions [33], and pragmatic trials [34]. Additional extensions are forthcoming: for those and for up to date references relevant to this checklist, see http://www.consort-statement.org.

That support seems warranted: when used by authors and journals, CON-SORT seems to improve reporting [9].

Development of CONSORT 2010

Thirty one members of the CONSORT 2010 Group met in Montebello, Canada, in January 2007 to update the 2001 CONSORT statement. In addition to the accumulating evidence relating to existing checklist items, several new issues had come to prominence since 2001. Some participants were given primary responsibility for aggre-gating and synthesising the relevant evidence on a particular checklist item of interest. Based on that evidence, the group deliberated the value of each item. As in prior CONSORT versions, we kept only those items deemed absolutely fundamental to reporting a randomised controlled trial. Moreover, an item may be fundamental to a trial but not included, such as approval by an institutional ethical review board, because funding bodies strictly enforce ethical review and medical journals usually address reporting ethical review in their instructions for authors. Other items may seem desirable, such as reporting on whether on-site monitoring was done, but a lack of empirical evidence or any consensus on their value cautions against inclusion at this point. The CONSORT 2010 Statement thus addresses the minimum criteria, although that should not deter authors from including other information if they consider it important.
After the meeting, the CONSORT Executive convened teleconferences and meetings to revise the checklist. After seven major iterations, a revised checklist was distributed to the larger group for feedback. With that feedback, the executive met twice in person to consider all the comments and to produce a penultimate version. That served as the basis for writing the first draft of this paper, which was then distributed to the group for feedback. After consideration of their comments, the executive finalised the statement.
The CONSORT Executive then drafted an updated explanation and elaboration manuscript, with assistance from other members of the larger group. The substance of the 2007 CONSORT meeting provided the material for the update. The updated explanation and elaboration manuscript was distributed to the entire group for additions, deletions, and changes. That final iterative process converged to the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13].

Changes in CONSORT 2010

The revision process resulted in evolutionary, not revolutionary, changes to the checklist (Table 1), and the flow diagram was not modified except for one word (Figure 1). Moreover, because other reporting guidelines augmenting the checklist refer to item numbers, we kept the existing items under their previous item numbers except for some renumbering of items 2 to 5. We added additional items either as a sub-item under an existing item, an entirely new item number at the end of the checklist, or (with item 3) an interjected item into a renumbered segment. We have summarised the noteworthy general changes in Appendix 1 and specific changes in Appendix 2. The CONSORT website contains a side by side comparison of the 2001 and 2010 versions.

Implications and limitations

We developed CONSORT 2010 to assist authors in writing reports of randomised controlled trials, editors and peer reviewers in reviewing manuscripts for publication, and readers in critically appraising published articles. The CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration provides elucidation and context to the checklist items. We strongly recommend using the explanation and elaboration in conjunction with the checklist to foster complete, clear, and transparent reporting and aid appraisal of published trial reports.
CONSORT 2010 focuses predominantly on the two group, parallel randomised controlled trial, which accounts for over half of trials in the literature [2]. Most of the items from the CONSORT 2010 Statement, however, pertain to all types of randomised trials. Nevertheless, some types of trials or trial situations dictate the need for additional information in the trial report. When in doubt, authors, editors, and readers should consult the CONSORT website for any CONSORT extensions, expansions (amplifications), implementations, or other guidance that may be relevant.
The evidence based approach we have used for CON-SORT also served as a model for development of other reporting guidelines, such as for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies evaluating interventions [16], diagnostic studies [17], and observational studies [18]. The explicit goal of all these initiatives is to improve reporting. The Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network will facilitate development of reporting guidelines and help disseminate the guidelines: http://www.equator-network.org provides information on all reporting guidelines in health research.
With CONSORT 2010, we again intentionally declined to produce a rigid structure for the reporting of randomised trials. Indeed, SORT [19] tried a rigid format, and it failed in a pilot run with an editor and authors [20]. Consequently, the format of articles should abide by journal style, editorial directions, the traditions of the research field addressed, and, where possible, author preferences. We do not wish to standardise the structure of reporting. Authors should simply address checklist items somewhere in the article, with ample detail and lucidity. That stated, we think that manuscripts benefit from frequent subheadings within the major sections, especially the methods and results sections.
CONSORT urges completeness, clarity, and transparency of reporting, which simply reflects the actual trial design and conduct. However, as a potential drawback, a reporting guideline might encourage some authors to report fictitiously the information suggested by the guidance rather than what was actually done. Authors, peer reviewers, and editors should vigilantly guard against that potential drawback and refer, for example, to trial protocols, to information on trial registers, and to regulatory agency websites. Moreover, the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing and conducting randomised trials. The items should elicit clear pronouncements of how and what the authors did, but do not contain any judgments on how and what the authors should have done. Thus, CONSORT 2010 is not intended as an instrument to evaluate the quality of a trial. Nor is it appropriate to use the checklist to construct a "quality score."
Nevertheless, we suggest that researchers begin trials with their end publication in mind. Poor reporting allows authors, intentionally or inadvertently, to escape scrutiny of any weak aspects of their trials. However, with wide adoption of CONSORT by journals and editorial groups, most authors should have to report transparently all important aspects of their trial. The ensuing scrutiny rewards well conducted trials and penalises poorly conducted trials. Thus, investigators should understand the CONSORT 2010 reporting guidelines before starting a trial as a further incentive to design and conduct their trials according to rigorous standards.
CONSORT 2010 supplants the prior version published in 2001. Any support for the earlier version accumulated from journals or editorial groups will automatically extend to this newer version, unless specifically requested otherwise. Journals that do not currently support CON-SORT may do so by registering on the CONSORT website. If a journal supports or endorses CONSORT 2010, it should cite one of the original versions of CONSORT 2010, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration, and the CONSORT website in their "Instructions to authors." We suggest that authors who wish to cite CON-SORT should cite this or another of the original journal versions of CONSORT 2010 Statement, and, if appropriate, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13]. All CONSORT material can be accessed through the original publishing journals or the CONSORT website. Groups or individuals who desire to translate the CON-SORT 2010 Statement into other languages should first consult the CONSORT policy statement on the website.
We emphasise that CONSORT 2010 represents an evolving guideline. It requires perpetual reappraisal and, if necessary, modifications. In the future we will further revise the CONSORT material considering comments, criticisms, experiences, and accumulating new evidence. We invite readers to submit recommendations via the CONSORT website.

Appendix 1: Noteworthy general changes in CONSORT 2010 Statement

• We simplified and clarified the wording, such as in items 1, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, and 21 • We improved consistency of style across the items by removing the imperative verbs that were in the 2001 version
• We enhanced specificity of appraisal by breaking some items into sub-items. Many journals expect authors to complete a CONSORT checklist indicating where in the manuscript the items have been addressed. Experience with the checklist noted pragmatic difficulties when an item comprised multiple elements. For example, item 4 addresses eligibility of participants and the settings and locations of data collection. With the 2001 version, an author could provide a page number for that item on the checklist, but might have reported only eligibility in the paper, for example, and not reported the settings and locations. CONSORT 2010 relieves obfuscations and forces authors to provide page numbers in the checklist for both eligibility and settings.

Appendix 2: Noteworthy specific changes in CONSORT 2010 Statement

Item 1b (title and abstract)-We added a sub-item on providing a structured summary of trial design, methods, results, and conclusions and referenced the CONSORT for abstracts article [21].

Item 2b (introduction)-We added a new sub-item (formerly item 5 in CONSORT 2001) on "Specific objectives or hypotheses"

Item 3a (trial design)-We added a new item including this sub-item to clarify the basic trial design (such as parallel group, crossover, cluster) and the allocation ratio Item 3b (trial design)-We added a new sub-item that addresses any important changes to methods after trial commencement, with a discussion of reasons

Item 4 (participants)-Formerly item 3 in CONSORT 2001

Item 5 (interventions)-Formerly item 4 in CONSORT 2001. We encouraged greater specificity by stating that descriptions of interventions should include "sufficient details to allow replication" [3] Item 6 (outcomes)-We added a sub-item on identifying any changes to the primary and secondary outcome (endpoint) measures after the trial started. This followed from empirical evidence that authors frequently provide analyses of outcomes in their published papers that were not the prespecified primary and secondary outcomes in their protocols, while ignoring their prespecified outcomes (that is, selective outcome reporting) [4,22]. We eliminated text on any methods used to enhance the quality of measurements Item 9 (allocation concealment mechanism)-We reworded this to include mechanism in both the report topic and the descriptor to reinforce that authors should report the actual steps taken to ensure allocation concealment rather than simply report imprecise, perhaps banal, assurances of concealment Item 11 (blinding)-We added the specification of how blinding was done and, if relevant, a description of the similarity of interventions and procedures. We also eliminated text on "how the success of blinding (masking) was assessed" because of a lack of empirical evidence supporting the practice as well as theoretical concerns about the validity of any such assessment [23,24] Item 12a (statistical methods)-We added that statistical methods should also be provided for analysis of secondary outcomes Sub-item 14b (recruitment)-Based on empirical research, we added a sub-item on "Why the trial ended or was stopped" [25] Item 15 (baseline data)-We specified "A table" to clarify that baseline and clinical characteristics of each group are most clearly expressed in a table Item 16 (numbers analysed)-We replaced mention of "intention to treat" analysis, a widely misused term, by a more explicit request for information about retaining participants in their original assigned groups [26] Sub-item 17b (outcomes and estimation)-For appropriate clinical interpretability, prevailing experience suggested the addition of "For binary outcomes, presentation of both relative and absolute effect sizes is recommended" [27] Item 19 (harms)-We included a reference to the CON-SORT paper on harms [28] Item 20 (limitations)-We changed the topic from "Interpretation" and supplanted the prior text with a sentence focusing on the reporting of sources of potential bias and imprecision Item 22 (interpretation)-We changed the topic from "Overall evidence." Indeed, we understand that authors should be allowed leeway for interpretation under this nebulous heading. However, the CONSORT Group expressed concerns that conclusions in papers frequently misrepresented the actual analytical results and that harms were ignored or marginalised. Therefore, we changed the checklist item to include the concepts of results matching interpretations and of benefits being balanced with harms Item 23 (registration)-We added a new item on trial registration. Empirical evidence supports the need for trial registration, and recent requirements by journal editors have fostered compliance [29] Item 24 (protocol)-We added a new item on availability of the trial protocol. Empirical evidence suggests that authors often ignore, in the conduct and reporting of their trial, what they stated in the protocol [4,22]. Hence, availability of the protocol can instigate adherence to the protocol before publication and facilitate assessment of adherence after publication Item 25 (funding)-We added a new item on funding. Empirical evidence points toward funding source sometimes being associated with estimatedeatment effects [30] Competing interests Uniform disclosure of potential conflicts of interest: all authors have completed the ICMJE unified competing interest form at http://www.icmje.org/ coi_disclosure.pdf (available from the corresponding author) and declare (1) DM received grants for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; KFS and DGA received support for travel to meetings for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; (2) KFS and DA had travel expenses reimbursed by the EQUATOR Network; KFS has received honoraria for delivering educational presentations for the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology Foundation for Excellence in Women's Health Care, Ortho-McNeil Janssen Scientific Affairs, and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology; and has done consultancy for Wyeth. All authors also declare (3) no spouses, partners, or children with relationships with commercial entities that might have an interest in the submitted work; (4) no non-financial interests that may be relevant to the submitted work.
Authors' contributions KFS, DM, and DGA participated in meetings and regular conference calls, planned the CONSORT 2007 meeting at Montebello, developed the agenda, prepared background research, identified and invited participants, contributed to the CONSORT meeting, drafted the manuscript, and, after critical review by the CONSORT Group, finalised the text of the manuscript. Members of the CONSORT Group attended the meeting, except for those noted below, and provided input on and review of the revised checklist and text of this article. Some members also prepared background material.

Introduction

Randomised controlled trials, when appropriately designed, conducted, and reported, represent the gold standard in evaluating healthcare interventions. However, randomised trials can yield biased results if they lack methodological rigour [1]. To assess a trial accurately, readers of a published report need complete, clear, and transparent information on its methodology and findings. Unfortunately, attempted assessments frequently fail because authors of many trial reports neglect to provide lucid and complete descriptions of that critical information [2][3][4].
That lack of adequate reporting fuelled the development of the original CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement in 1996 [5] and its revision five years later [6][7][8]. While those statements improved the reporting quality for some randomised controlled trials, [9,10] many trial reports still remain inadequate [2]. Furthermore, new methodological evidence and additional experience has accumulated since the last revision in 2001. Consequently, we organised a CONSORT Group meeting to update the 2001 statement [6][7][8]. We introduce here the result of that process, CONSORT 2010.

Intent of CONSORT 2010

The CONSORT 2010 Statement is this paper including the 25 item checklist in the table (Table 1) and the flow diagram ( Figure 1). It provides guidance for reporting all randomised controlled trials, but focuses on the most common design type-individually randomised, two group, parallel trials. Other trial designs, such as cluster randomised trials and non-inferiority trials, require varying amounts of additional information. CONSORT extensions for these designs, [11,12] and other CON-SORT products, can be found through the CONSORT website http://www.consort-statement.org. Along with the CONSORT statement, we have updated the explanation and elaboration article, [13] which explains the inclusion of each checklist item, provides methodological background, and gives published examples of transparent reporting.
Diligent adherence by authors to the checklist items facilitates clarity, completeness, and transparency of reporting. Explicit descriptions, not ambiguity or omission, best serve the interests of all readers. Note that the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing, conducting, and analysing trials. It solely addresses the reporting of what was done and what was found.
Nevertheless, CONSORT does indirectly affect design and conduct. Transparent reporting reveals deficiencies in research if they exist. Thus, investigators who conduct inadequate trials, but who must transparently report, should not be able to pass through the publication process without revelation of their trial's inadequacies. That emerging reality should provide impetus to improved trial design and conduct in the future, a secondary indirect goal of our work. Moreover, CONSORT can help researchers in designing their trial.  Background to CONSORT Efforts to improve the reporting of randomised controlled trials accelerated in the mid-1990s, spurred partly by methodological research. Researchers had shown for many years that authors reported such trials poorly, and empirical evidence began to accumulate that some poorly conducted or poorly reported aspects of trials were associated with bias [14]. Two initiatives aimed at developing reporting guidelines culminated in one of us (DM) and Drummond Rennie organising the first CONSORT statement in 1996 [5]. Further methodological research on similar topics reinforced earlier findings [15] and fed into the revision of 2001 [6][7][8]. Subsequently, the expanding body of methodological research informed the refinement of CONSORT 2010. More than 700 studies com-prise the CONSORT database (located on the CONSORT website), which provides the empirical evidence to underpin the CONSORT initiative. Indeed, CONSORT Group members continually monitor the literature. Information gleaned from these efforts provides an evidence base on which to update the CON-SORT statement. We add, drop, or modify items based on that evidence and the recommendations of the CON-SORT Group, an international and eclectic group of clinical trialists, statisticians, epidemiologists, and biomedical editors. The CONSORT Executive (KFS, DGA, DM) strives for a balance of established and emerging researchers. The membership of the group is dynamic. As our work expands in response to emerging projects and needed expertise, we invite new members to contribute. Sources of funding and other support (such as supply of drugs), role of funders *We strongly recommend reading this statement in conjunction with the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13] for important clarifications on all the items. If relevant, we also recommend reading CONSORT extensions for cluster randomised trials [11], non-inferiority and equivalence trials [12], non-pharmacological treatments [32], herbal interventions [33], and pragmatic trials [34]. Additional extensions are forthcoming: for those and for up to date references relevant to this checklist, see http://www.consort-statement.org.

Table 1: CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a randomised trial* (Continued)

As such, CONSORT continually assimilates new ideas and perspectives. That process informs the continually evolving CONSORT statement. Over time, CONSORT has garnered much support. More than 400 journals, published around the world and in many languages, have explicitly supported the CON-SORT statement. Many other healthcare journals support it without our knowledge. Moreover, thousands more have implicitly supported it with the endorsement of the CONSORT statement by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors http://www.icmje.org. Other prominent editorial groups, the Council of Science Editors and the World Association of Medical Editors, officially support CONSORT. That support seems warranted: when used by authors and journals, CON-SORT seems to improve reporting [9].

Development of CONSORT 2010

Thirty one members of the CONSORT 2010 Group met in Montebello, Canada, in January 2007 to update the 2001 CONSORT statement.

Introduction

Randomised controlled trials, when appropriately designed, conducted, and reported, represent the gold standard in evaluating healthcare interventions. However, randomised trials can yield biased results if they lack methodological rigour [1]. To assess a trial accurately, readers of a published report need complete, clear, and transparent information on its methodology and findings. Unfortunately, attempted assessments frequently fail because authors of many trial reports neglect to provide lucid and complete descriptions of that critical information [2][3][4].
That lack of adequate reporting fuelled the development of the original CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement in 1996 [5] and its revision five years later [6][7][8]. While those statements improved the reporting quality for some randomised controlled trials, [9,10] many trial reports still remain inadequate [2]. Furthermore, new methodological evidence and additional experience has accumulated since the last revision in 2001. Consequently, we organised a CONSORT Group meeting to update the 2001 statement [6][7][8]. We introduce here the result of that process, CONSORT 2010.

Intent of CONSORT 2010

The CONSORT 2010 Statement is this paper including the 25 item checklist in the table (Table 1) and the flow diagram ( Figure 1). It provides guidance for reporting all randomised controlled trials, but focuses on the most common design type-individually randomised, two group, parallel trials. Other trial designs, such as cluster randomised trials and non-inferiority trials, require varying amounts of additional information. CONSORT extensions for these designs, [11,12] and other CON-SORT products, can be found through the CONSORT website http://www.consort-statement.org. Along with the CONSORT statement, we have updated the explanation and elaboration article, [13] which explains the inclusion of each checklist item, provides methodological background, and gives published examples of transparent reporting.
Diligent adherence by authors to the checklist items facilitates clarity, completeness, and transparency of reporting. Explicit descriptions, not ambiguity or omission, best serve the interests of all readers. Note that the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing, conducting, and analysing trials. It solely addresses the reporting of what was done and what was found.
Nevertheless, CONSORT does indirectly affect design and conduct. Transparent reporting reveals deficiencies in research if they exist. Thus, investigators who conduct inadequate trials, but who must transparently report, should not be able to pass through the publication process without revelation of their trial's inadequacies. That emerging reality should provide impetus to improved trial design and conduct in the future, a secondary indirect goal of our work. Moreover, CONSORT can help researchers in designing their trial.  Background to CONSORT Efforts to improve the reporting of randomised controlled trials accelerated in the mid-1990s, spurred partly by methodological research. Researchers had shown for many years that authors reported such trials poorly, and empirical evidence began to accumulate that some poorly conducted or poorly reported aspects of trials were associated with bias [14]. Two initiatives aimed at developing reporting guidelines culminated in one of us (DM) and Drummond Rennie organising the first CONSORT statement in 1996 [5]. Further methodological research on similar topics reinforced earlier findings [15] and fed into the revision of 2001 [6][7][8]. Subsequently, the expanding body of methodological research informed the refinement of CONSORT 2010. More than 700 studies com-prise the CONSORT database (located on the CONSORT website), which provides the empirical evidence to underpin the CONSORT initiative. Indeed, CONSORT Group members continually monitor the literature. Information gleaned from these efforts provides an evidence base on which to update the CON-SORT statement. We add, drop, or modify items based on that evidence and the recommendations of the CON-SORT Group, an international and eclectic group of clinical trialists, statisticians, epidemiologists, and biomedical editors. The CONSORT Executive (KFS, DGA, DM) strives for a balance of established and emerging researchers. The membership of the group is dynamic. As our work expands in response to emerging projects and needed expertise, we invite new members to contribute. Sources of funding and other support (such as supply of drugs), role of funders *We strongly recommend reading this statement in conjunction with the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13] for important clarifications on all the items. If relevant, we also recommend reading CONSORT extensions for cluster randomised trials [11], non-inferiority and equivalence trials [12], non-pharmacological treatments [32], herbal interventions [33], and pragmatic trials [34]. Additional extensions are forthcoming: for those and for up to date references relevant to this checklist, see http://www.consort-statement.org.

Table 1: CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a randomised trial* (Continued)

As such, CONSORT continually assimilates new ideas and perspectives. That process informs the continually evolving CONSORT statement. Over time, CONSORT has garnered much support. More than 400 journals, published around the world and in many languages, have explicitly supported the CON-SORT statement. Many other healthcare journals support it without our knowledge. Moreover, thousands more have implicitly supported it with the endorsement of the CONSORT statement by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors http://www.icmje.org. Other prominent editorial groups, the Council of Science Editors and the World Association of Medical Editors, officially support CONSORT. That support seems warranted: when used by authors and journals, CON-SORT seems to improve reporting [9].

Development of CONSORT 2010

Thirty one members of the CONSORT 2010 Group met in Montebello, Canada, in January 2007 to update the 2001 CONSORT statement. In addition to the accumulating evidence relating to existing checklist items, several new issues had come to prominence since 2001. Some participants were given primary responsibility for aggre-gating and synthesising the relevant evidence on a particular checklist item of interest. Based on that evidence, the group deliberated the value of each item. As in prior CONSORT versions, we kept only those items deemed absolutely fundamental to reporting a randomised controlled trial. Moreover, an item may be fundamental to a trial but not included, such as approval by an institutional ethical review board, because funding bodies strictly enforce ethical review and medical journals usually address reporting ethical review in their instructions for authors. Other items may seem desirable, such as reporting on whether on-site monitoring was done, but a lack of empirical evidence or any consensus on their value cautions against inclusion at this point. The CONSORT 2010 Statement thus addresses the minimum criteria, although that should not deter authors from including other information if they consider it important.
After the meeting, the CONSORT Executive convened teleconferences and meetings to revise the checklist. After seven major iterations, a revised checklist was distributed to the larger group for feedback. With that feedback, the executive met twice in person to consider all the comments and to produce a penultimate version. That served as the basis for writing the first draft of this paper, which was then distributed to the group for feedback. After consideration of their comments, the executive finalised the statement.
The CONSORT Executive then drafted an updated explanation and elaboration manuscript, with assistance from other members of the larger group. The substance of the 2007 CONSORT meeting provided the material for the update. The updated explanation and elaboration manuscript was distributed to the entire group for additions, deletions, and changes. That final iterative process converged to the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13].

Changes in CONSORT 2010

The revision process resulted in evolutionary, not revolutionary, changes to the checklist (Table 1), and the flow diagram was not modified except for one word (Figure 1). Moreover, because other reporting guidelines augmenting the checklist refer to item numbers, we kept the existing items under their previous item numbers except for some renumbering of items 2 to 5. We added additional items either as a sub-item under an existing item, an entirely new item number at the end of the checklist, or (with item 3) an interjected item into a renumbered segment. We have summarised the noteworthy general changes in Appendix 1 and specific changes in Appendix 2. The CONSORT website contains a side by side comparison of the 2001 and 2010 versions.

Implications and limitations

We developed CONSORT 2010 to assist authors in writing reports of randomised controlled trials, editors and peer reviewers in reviewing manuscripts for publication, and readers in critically appraising published articles. The CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration provides elucidation and context to the checklist items. We strongly recommend using the explanation and elaboration in conjunction with the checklist to foster complete, clear, and transparent reporting and aid appraisal of published trial reports.
CONSORT 2010 focuses predominantly on the two group, parallel randomised controlled trial, which accounts for over half of trials in the literature [2]. Most of the items from the CONSORT 2010 Statement, however, pertain to all types of randomised trials. Nevertheless, some types of trials or trial situations dictate the need for additional information in the trial report. When in doubt, authors, editors, and readers should consult the CONSORT website for any CONSORT extensions, expansions (amplifications), implementations, or other guidance that may be relevant.
The evidence based approach we have used for CON-SORT also served as a model for development of other reporting guidelines, such as for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies evaluating interventions [16], diagnostic studies [17], and observational studies [18]. The explicit goal of all these initiatives is to improve reporting. The Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network will facilitate development of reporting guidelines and help disseminate the guidelines: http://www.equator-network.org provides information on all reporting guidelines in health research.
With CONSORT 2010, we again intentionally declined to produce a rigid structure for the reporting of randomised trials. Indeed, SORT [19] tried a rigid format, and it failed in a pilot run with an editor and authors [20]. Consequently, the format of articles should abide by journal style, editorial directions, the traditions of the research field addressed, and, where possible, author preferences. We do not wish to standardise the structure of reporting. Authors should simply address checklist items somewhere in the article, with ample detail and lucidity. That stated, we think that manuscripts benefit from frequent subheadings within the major sections, especially the methods and results sections.
CONSORT urges completeness, clarity, and transparency of reporting, which simply reflects the actual trial design and conduct. However, as a potential drawback, a reporting guideline might encourage some authors to report fictitiously the information suggested by the guidance rather than what was actually done. Authors, peer reviewers, and editors should vigilantly guard against that potential drawback and refer, for example, to trial protocols, to information on trial registers, and to regulatory agency websites. Moreover, the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing and conducting randomised trials. The items should elicit clear pronouncements of how and what the authors did, but do not contain any judgments on how and what the authors should have done. Thus, CONSORT 2010 is not intended as an instrument to evaluate the quality of a trial. Nor is it appropriate to use the checklist to construct a "quality score."
Nevertheless, we suggest that researchers begin trials with their end publication in mind. Poor reporting allows authors, intentionally or inadvertently, to escape scrutiny of any weak aspects of their trials. However, with wide adoption of CONSORT by journals and editorial groups, most authors should have to report transparently all important aspects of their trial. The ensuing scrutiny rewards well conducted trials and penalises poorly conducted trials. Thus, investigators should understand the CONSORT 2010 reporting guidelines before starting a trial as a further incentive to design and conduct their trials according to rigorous standards.
CONSORT 2010 supplants the prior version published in 2001. Any support for the earlier version accumulated from journals or editorial groups will automatically extend to this newer version, unless specifically requested otherwise. Journals that do not currently support CON-SORT may do so by registering on the CONSORT website. If a journal supports or endorses CONSORT 2010, it should cite one of the original versions of CONSORT 2010, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration, and the CONSORT website in their "Instructions to authors." We suggest that authors who wish to cite CON-SORT should cite this or another of the original journal versions of CONSORT 2010 Statement, and, if appropriate, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13]. All CONSORT material can be accessed through the original publishing journals or the CONSORT website. Groups or individuals who desire to translate the CON-SORT 2010 Statement into other languages should first consult the CONSORT policy statement on the website.
We emphasise that CONSORT 2010 represents an evolving guideline. It requires perpetual reappraisal and, if necessary, modifications. In the future we will further revise the CONSORT material considering comments, criticisms, experiences, and accumulating new evidence. We invite readers to submit recommendations via the CONSORT website.

Appendix 1: Noteworthy general changes in CONSORT 2010 Statement

• We simplified and clarified the wording, such as in items 1, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, and 21 • We improved consistency of style across the items by removing the imperative verbs that were in the 2001 version
• We enhanced specificity of appraisal by breaking some items into sub-items. Many journals expect authors to complete a CONSORT checklist indicating where in the manuscript the items have been addressed. Experience with the checklist noted pragmatic difficulties when an item comprised multiple elements. For example, item 4 addresses eligibility of participants and the settings and locations of data collection. With the 2001 version, an author could provide a page number for that item on the checklist, but might have reported only eligibility in the paper, for example, and not reported the settings and locations. CONSORT 2010 relieves obfuscations and forces authors to provide page numbers in the checklist for both eligibility and settings.

Appendix 2: Noteworthy specific changes in CONSORT 2010 Statement

Item 1b (title and abstract)-We added a sub-item on providing a structured summary of trial design, methods, results, and conclusions and referenced the CONSORT for abstracts article [21].

Item 2b (introduction)-We added a new sub-item (formerly item 5 in CONSORT 2001) on "Specific objectives or hypotheses"

Item 3a (trial design)-We added a new item including this sub-item to clarify the basic trial design (such as parallel group, crossover, cluster) and the allocation ratio Item 3b (trial design)-We added a new sub-item that addresses any important changes to methods after trial commencement, with a discussion of reasons

Item 4 (participants)-Formerly item 3 in CONSORT 2001

Item 5 (interventions)-Formerly item 4 in CONSORT 2001. We encouraged greater specificity by stating that descriptions of interventions should include "sufficient details to allow replication" [3] Item 6 (outcomes)-We added a sub-item on identifying any changes to the primary and secondary outcome (endpoint) measures after the trial started. This followed from empirical evidence that authors frequently provide analyses of outcomes in their published papers that were not the prespecified primary and secondary outcomes in their protocols, while ignoring their prespecified outcomes (that is, selective outcome reporting) [4,22]. We eliminated text on any methods used to enhance the quality of measurements Item 9 (allocation concealment mechanism)-We reworded this to include mechanism in both the report topic and the descriptor to reinforce that authors should report the actual steps taken to ensure allocation concealment rather than simply report imprecise, perhaps banal, assurances of concealment Item 11 (blinding)-We added the specification of how blinding was done and, if relevant, a description of the similarity of interventions and procedures. We also eliminated text on "how the success of blinding (masking) was assessed" because of a lack of empirical evidence supporting the practice as well as theoretical concerns about the validity of any such assessment [23,24] Item 12a (statistical methods)-We added that statistical methods should also be provided for analysis of secondary outcomes Sub-item 14b (recruitment)-Based on empirical research, we added a sub-item on "Why the trial ended or was stopped" [25] Item 15 (baseline data)-We specified "A table" to clarify that baseline and clinical characteristics of each group are most clearly expressed in a table Item 16 (numbers analysed)-We replaced mention of "intention to treat" analysis, a widely misused term, by a more explicit request for information about retaining participants in their original assigned groups [26] Sub-item 17b (outcomes and estimation)-For appropriate clinical interpretability, prevailing experience suggested the addition of "For binary outcomes, presentation of both relative and absolute effect sizes is recommended" [27] Item 19 (harms)-We included a reference to the CON-SORT paper on harms [28] Item 20 (limitations)-We changed the topic from "Interpretation" and supplanted the prior text with a sentence focusing on the reporting of sources of potential bias and imprecision Item 22 (interpretation)-We changed the topic from "Overall evidence." Indeed, we understand that authors should be allowed leeway for interpretation under this nebulous heading. However, the CONSORT Group expressed concerns that conclusions in papers frequently misrepresented the actual analytical results and that harms were ignored or marginalised. Therefore, we changed the checklist item to include the concepts of results matching interpretations and of benefits being balanced with harms Item 23 (registration)-We added a new item on trial registration. Empirical evidence supports the need for trial registration, and recent requirements by journal editors have fostered compliance [29] Item 24 (protocol)-We added a new item on availability of the trial protocol. Empirical evidence suggests that authors often ignore, in the conduct and reporting of their trial, what they stated in the protocol [4,22]. Hence, availability of the protocol can instigate adherence to the protocol before publication and facilitate assessment of adherence after publication Item 25 (funding)-We added a new item on funding. Empirical evidence points toward funding source sometimes being associated with estimatedeatment effects [30] Competing interests Uniform disclosure of potential conflicts of interest: all authors have completed the ICMJE unified competing interest form at http://www.icmje.org/ coi_disclosure.pdf (available from the corresponding author) and declare (1) DM received grants for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; KFS and DGA received support for travel to meetings for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; (2) KFS and DA had travel expenses reimbursed by the EQUATOR Network; KFS has received honoraria for delivering educational presentations for the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology Foundation for Excellence in Women's Health Care, Ortho-McNeil Janssen Scientific Affairs, and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology; and has done consultancy for Wyeth.

Authors' contributions KFS, DM, and DGA participated in meetings and regular conference calls, planned the CONSORT 2007 meeting at Montebello, developed the agenda, prepared background research, identified and invited participants, contributed to the CONSORT meeting, drafted the manuscript, and, after critical review by the CONSORT Group, finalised the text of the manuscript. Members of the CONSORT Group attended the meeting, except for those noted below, and provided input on and review of the revised checklist and text of this article. Some members also prepared background material.

Introduction

Randomised controlled trials, when appropriately designed, conducted, and reported, represent the gold standard in evaluating healthcare interventions. However, randomised trials can yield biased results if they lack methodological rigour [1]. To assess a trial accurately, readers of a published report need complete, clear, and transparent information on its methodology and findings. Unfortunately, attempted assessments frequently fail because authors of many trial reports neglect to provide lucid and complete descriptions of that critical information [2][3][4].
That lack of adequate reporting fuelled the development of the original CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement in 1996 [5] and its revision five years later [6][7][8]. While those statements improved the reporting quality for some randomised controlled trials, [9,10] many trial reports still remain inadequate [2]. Furthermore, new methodological evidence and additional experience has accumulated since the last revision in 2001. Consequently, we organised a CONSORT Group meeting to update the 2001 statement [6][7][8]. We introduce here the result of that process, CONSORT 2010.

Intent of CONSORT 2010

The CONSORT 2010 Statement is this paper including the 25 item checklist in the table (Table 1) and the flow diagram ( Figure 1). It provides guidance for reporting all randomised controlled trials, but focuses on the most common design type-individually randomised, two group, parallel trials. Other trial designs, such as cluster randomised trials and non-inferiority trials, require varying amounts of additional information. CONSORT extensions for these designs, [11,12] and other CON-SORT products, can be found through the CONSORT website http://www.consort-statement.org. Along with the CONSORT statement, we have updated the explanation and elaboration article, [13] which explains the inclusion of each checklist item, provides methodological background, and gives published examples of transparent reporting.
Diligent adherence by authors to the checklist items facilitates clarity, completeness, and transparency of reporting. Explicit descriptions, not ambiguity or omission, best serve the interests of all readers. Note that the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing, conducting, and analysing trials. It solely addresses the reporting of what was done and what was found.

Appendix 2: Noteworthy specific changes in CONSORT 2010 Statement

Item 1b (title and abstract)-We added a sub-item on providing a structured summary of trial design, methods, results, and conclusions and referenced the CONSORT for abstracts article [21].

Item 2b (introduction)-We added a new sub-item (formerly item 5 in CONSORT 2001) on "Specific objectives or hypotheses"

Item 3a (trial design)-We added a new item including this sub-item to clarify the basic trial design (such as parallel group, crossover, cluster) and the allocation ratio Item 3b (trial design)-We added a new sub-item that addresses any important changes to methods after trial commencement, with a discussion of reasons

We eliminated text on any methods used to enhance the quality of measurements Item 9 (allocation concealment mechanism)-We reworded this to include mechanism in both the report topic and the descriptor to reinforce that authors should report the actual steps taken to ensure allocation concealment rather than simply report imprecise, perhaps banal, assurances of concealment Item 11 (blinding)-We added the specification of how blinding was done and, if relevant, a description of the similarity of interventions and procedures. We also eliminated text on "how the success of blinding (masking) was assessed" because of a lack of empirical evidence supporting the practice as well as theoretical concerns about the validity of any such assessment [23,24] Item 12a (statistical methods)-We added that statistical methods should also be provided for analysis of secondary outcomes Sub-item 14b (recruitment)-Based on empirical research, we added a sub-item on "Why the trial ended or was stopped" [25] Item 15 (baseline data)-We specified "A table" to clarify that baseline and clinical characteristics of each group are most clearly expressed in a table Item 16 (numbers analysed)-We replaced mention of "intention to treat" analysis, a widely misused term, by a more explicit request for information about retaining participants in their original assigned groups [26] Sub-item 17b (outcomes and estimation)-For appropriate clinical interpretability, prevailing experience suggested the addition of "For binary outcomes, presentation of both relative and absolute effect sizes is recommended" [27] Item 19 (harms)-We included a reference to the CON-SORT paper on harms [28] Item 20 (limitations)-We changed the topic from "Interpretation" and supplanted the prior text with a sentence focusing on the reporting of sources of potential bias and imprecision Item 22 (interpretation)-We changed the topic from "Overall evidence." Indeed, we understand that authors should be allowed leeway for interpretation under this nebulous heading. However, the CONSORT Group expressed concerns that conclusions in papers frequently misrepresented the actual analytical results and that harms were ignored or marginalised. Therefore, we changed the checklist item to include the concepts of results matching interpretations and of benefits being balanced with harms Item 23 (registration)-We added a new item on trial registration. Empirical evidence supports the need for trial registration, and recent requirements by journal editors have fostered compliance [29] Item 24 (protocol)-We added a new item on availability of the trial protocol. Empirical evidence suggests that authors often ignore, in the conduct and reporting of their trial, what they stated in the protocol [4,22]. Hence, availability of the protocol can instigate adherence to the protocol before publication and facilitate assessment of adherence after publication Item 25 (funding)-We added a new item on funding. Empirical evidence points toward funding source sometimes being associated with estimatedeatment effects [30] Competing interests Uniform disclosure of potential conflicts of interest: all authors have completed the ICMJE unified competing interest form at http://www.icmje.org/ coi_disclosure.pdf (available from the corresponding author) and declare (1) DM received grants for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; KFS and DGA received support for travel to meetings for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; (2) KFS and DA had travel expenses reimbursed by the EQUATOR Network; KFS has received honoraria for delivering educational presentations for the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology Foundation for Excellence in Women's Health Care, Ortho-McNeil Janssen Scientific Affairs, and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology; and has done consultancy for Wyeth.

Members of the CONSORT Group attended the meeting, except for those noted below, and provided input on and review of the revised checklist and text of this article. Some members also prepared background material.

Introduction

Randomised controlled trials, when appropriately designed, conducted, and reported, represent the gold standard in evaluating healthcare interventions. However, randomised trials can yield biased results if they lack methodological rigour [1]. To assess a trial accurately, readers of a published report need complete, clear, and transparent information on its methodology and findings. Unfortunately, attempted assessments frequently fail because authors of many trial reports neglect to provide lucid and complete descriptions of that critical information [2][3][4].
That lack of adequate reporting fuelled the development of the original CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement in 1996 [5] and its revision five years later [6][7][8]. While those statements improved the reporting quality for some randomised controlled trials, [9,10] many trial reports still remain inadequate [2]. Furthermore, new methodological evidence and additional experience has accumulated since the last revision in 2001. Consequently, we organised a CONSORT Group meeting to update the 2001 statement [6][7][8]. We introduce here the result of that process, CONSORT 2010.

Intent of CONSORT 2010

The CONSORT 2010 Statement is this paper including the 25 item checklist in the table (Table 1) and the flow diagram ( Figure 1). It provides guidance for reporting all randomised controlled trials, but focuses on the most common design type-individually randomised, two group, parallel trials. Other trial designs, such as cluster randomised trials and non-inferiority trials, require varying amounts of additional information. CONSORT extensions for these designs, [11,12] and other CON-SORT products, can be found through the CONSORT website http://www.consort-statement.org. Along with the CONSORT statement, we have updated the explanation and elaboration article, [13] which explains the inclusion of each checklist item, provides methodological background, and gives published examples of transparent reporting.
Diligent adherence by authors to the checklist items facilitates clarity, completeness, and transparency of reporting. Explicit descriptions, not ambiguity or omission, best serve the interests of all readers. Note that the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing, conducting, and analysing trials. It solely addresses the reporting of what was done and what was found.
Nevertheless, CONSORT does indirectly affect design and conduct. Transparent reporting reveals deficiencies in research if they exist. Thus, investigators who conduct inadequate trials, but who must transparently report, should not be able to pass through the publication process without revelation of their trial's inadequacies. That emerging reality should provide impetus to improved trial design and conduct in the future, a secondary indirect goal of our work. Moreover, CONSORT can help researchers in designing their trial.  Background to CONSORT Efforts to improve the reporting of randomised controlled trials accelerated in the mid-1990s, spurred partly by methodological research. Researchers had shown for many years that authors reported such trials poorly, and empirical evidence began to accumulate that some poorly conducted or poorly reported aspects of trials were associated with bias [14]. Two initiatives aimed at developing reporting guidelines culminated in one of us (DM) and Drummond Rennie organising the first CONSORT statement in 1996 [5]. Further methodological research on similar topics reinforced earlier findings [15] and fed into the revision of 2001 [6][7][8]. Subsequently, the expanding body of methodological research informed the refinement of CONSORT 2010. More than 700 studies com-prise the CONSORT database (located on the CONSORT website), which provides the empirical evidence to underpin the CONSORT initiative. Indeed, CONSORT Group members continually monitor the literature. Information gleaned from these efforts provides an evidence base on which to update the CON-SORT statement. We add, drop, or modify items based on that evidence and the recommendations of the CON-SORT Group, an international and eclectic group of clinical trialists, statisticians, epidemiologists, and biomedical editors. The CONSORT Executive (KFS, DGA, DM) strives for a balance of established and emerging researchers. The membership of the group is dynamic. As our work expands in response to emerging projects and needed expertise, we invite new members to contribute. Sources of funding and other support (such as supply of drugs), role of funders *We strongly recommend reading this statement in conjunction with the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13] for important clarifications on all the items. If relevant, we also recommend reading CONSORT extensions for cluster randomised trials [11], non-inferiority and equivalence trials [12], non-pharmacological treatments [32], herbal interventions [33], and pragmatic trials [34]. Additional extensions are forthcoming: for those and for up to date references relevant to this checklist, see http://www.consort-statement.org.

Table 1: CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a randomised trial* (Continued)

As such, CONSORT continually assimilates new ideas and perspectives. That process informs the continually evolving CONSORT statement. Over time, CONSORT has garnered much support. More than 400 journals, published around the world and in many languages, have explicitly supported the CON-SORT statement. Many other healthcare journals support it without our knowledge. Moreover, thousands more have implicitly supported it with the endorsement of the CONSORT statement by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors http://www.icmje.org. Other prominent editorial groups, the Council of Science Editors and the World Association of Medical Editors, officially support CONSORT. That support seems warranted: when used by authors and journals, CON-SORT seems to improve reporting [9].

Development of CONSORT 2010

Thirty one members of the CONSORT 2010 Group met in Montebello, Canada, in January 2007 to update the 2001 CONSORT statement. In addition to the accumulating evidence relating to existing checklist items, several new issues had come to prominence since 2001. Some participants were given primary responsibility for aggre-gating and synthesising the relevant evidence on a particular checklist item of interest. Based on that evidence, the group deliberated the value of each item. As in prior CONSORT versions, we kept only those items deemed absolutely fundamental to reporting a randomised controlled trial. Moreover, an item may be fundamental to a trial but not included, such as approval by an institutional ethical review board, because funding bodies strictly enforce ethical review and medical journals usually address reporting ethical review in their instructions for authors. Other items may seem desirable, such as reporting on whether on-site monitoring was done, but a lack of empirical evidence or any consensus on their value cautions against inclusion at this point. The CONSORT 2010 Statement thus addresses the minimum criteria, although that should not deter authors from including other information if they consider it important.
After the meeting, the CONSORT Executive convened teleconferences and meetings to revise the checklist. After seven major iterations, a revised checklist was distributed to the larger group for feedback. With that feedback, the executive met twice in person to consider all the comments and to produce a penultimate version. That served as the basis for writing the first draft of this paper, which was then distributed to the group for feedback. After consideration of their comments, the executive finalised the statement.
The CONSORT Executive then drafted an updated explanation and elaboration manuscript, with assistance from other members of the larger group. The substance of the 2007 CONSORT meeting provided the material for the update. The updated explanation and elaboration manuscript was distributed to the entire group for additions, deletions, and changes. That final iterative process converged to the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13].

Changes in CONSORT 2010

The revision process resulted in evolutionary, not revolutionary, changes to the checklist (Table 1), and the flow diagram was not modified except for one word (Figure 1). Moreover, because other reporting guidelines augmenting the checklist refer to item numbers, we kept the existing items under their previous item numbers except for some renumbering of items 2 to 5. We added additional items either as a sub-item under an existing item, an entirely new item number at the end of the checklist, or (with item 3) an interjected item into a renumbered segment. We have summarised the noteworthy general changes in Appendix 1 and specific changes in Appendix 2. The CONSORT website contains a side by side comparison of the 2001 and 2010 versions.

Implications and limitations

We developed CONSORT 2010 to assist authors in writing reports of randomised controlled trials, editors and peer reviewers in reviewing manuscripts for publication, and readers in critically appraising published articles. The CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration provides elucidation and context to the checklist items. We strongly recommend using the explanation and elaboration in conjunction with the checklist to foster complete, clear, and transparent reporting and aid appraisal of published trial reports.
CONSORT 2010 focuses predominantly on the two group, parallel randomised controlled trial, which accounts for over half of trials in the literature [2]. Most of the items from the CONSORT 2010 Statement, however, pertain to all types of randomised trials. Nevertheless, some types of trials or trial situations dictate the need for additional information in the trial report. When in doubt, authors, editors, and readers should consult the CONSORT website for any CONSORT extensions, expansions (amplifications), implementations, or other guidance that may be relevant.
The evidence based approach we have used for CON-SORT also served as a model for development of other reporting guidelines, such as for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies evaluating interventions [16], diagnostic studies [17], and observational studies [18]. The explicit goal of all these initiatives is to improve reporting. The Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network will facilitate development of reporting guidelines and help disseminate the guidelines: http://www.equator-network.org provides information on all reporting guidelines in health research.
With CONSORT 2010, we again intentionally declined to produce a rigid structure for the reporting of randomised trials. Indeed, SORT [19] tried a rigid format, and it failed in a pilot run with an editor and authors [20]. Consequently, the format of articles should abide by journal style, editorial directions, the traditions of the research field addressed, and, where possible, author preferences. We do not wish to standardise the structure of reporting. Authors should simply address checklist items somewhere in the article, with ample detail and lucidity. That stated, we think that manuscripts benefit from frequent subheadings within the major sections, especially the methods and results sections.
CONSORT urges completeness, clarity, and transparency of reporting, which simply reflects the actual trial design and conduct. However, as a potential drawback, a reporting guideline might encourage some authors to report fictitiously the information suggested by the guidance rather than what was actually done. Authors, peer reviewers, and editors should vigilantly guard against that potential drawback and refer, for example, to trial protocols, to information on trial registers, and to regulatory agency websites. Moreover, the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing and conducting randomised trials. The items should elicit clear pronouncements of how and what the authors did, but do not contain any judgments on how and what the authors should have done. Thus, CONSORT 2010 is not intended as an instrument to evaluate the quality of a trial. Nor is it appropriate to use the checklist to construct a "quality score."
Nevertheless, we suggest that researchers begin trials with their end publication in mind. Poor reporting allows authors, intentionally or inadvertently, to escape scrutiny of any weak aspects of their trials. However, with wide adoption of CONSORT by journals and editorial groups, most authors should have to report transparently all important aspects of their trial. The ensuing scrutiny rewards well conducted trials and penalises poorly conducted trials. Thus, investigators should understand the CONSORT 2010 reporting guidelines before starting a trial as a further incentive to design and conduct their trials according to rigorous standards.
CONSORT 2010 supplants the prior version published in 2001. Any support for the earlier version accumulated from journals or editorial groups will automatically extend to this newer version, unless specifically requested otherwise. Journals that do not currently support CON-SORT may do so by registering on the CONSORT website. If a journal supports or endorses CONSORT 2010, it should cite one of the original versions of CONSORT 2010, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration, and the CONSORT website in their "Instructions to authors." We suggest that authors who wish to cite CON-SORT should cite this or another of the original journal versions of CONSORT 2010 Statement, and, if appropriate, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13]. All CONSORT material can be accessed through the original publishing journals or the CONSORT website. Groups or individuals who desire to translate the CON-SORT 2010 Statement into other languages should first consult the CONSORT policy statement on the website.
We emphasise that CONSORT 2010 represents an evolving guideline. It requires perpetual reappraisal and, if necessary, modifications. In the future we will further revise the CONSORT material considering comments, criticisms, experiences, and accumulating new evidence. We invite readers to submit recommendations via the CONSORT website.

Appendix 1: Noteworthy general changes in CONSORT 2010 Statement

• We simplified and clarified the wording, such as in items 1, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, and 21 • We improved consistency of style across the items by removing the imperative verbs that were in the 2001 version
• We enhanced specificity of appraisal by breaking some items into sub-items. Many journals expect authors to complete a CONSORT checklist indicating where in the manuscript the items have been addressed. Experience with the checklist noted pragmatic difficulties when an item comprised multiple elements. For example, item 4 addresses eligibility of participants and the settings and locations of data collection. With the 2001 version, an author could provide a page number for that item on the checklist, but might have reported only eligibility in the paper, for example, and not reported the settings and locations. CONSORT 2010 relieves obfuscations and forces authors to provide page numbers in the checklist for both eligibility and settings.

Appendix 2: Noteworthy specific changes in CONSORT 2010 Statement

Item 1b (title and abstract)-We added a sub-item on providing a structured summary of trial design, methods, results, and conclusions and referenced the CONSORT for abstracts article [21].

Item 2b (introduction)-We added a new sub-item (formerly item 5 in CONSORT 2001) on "Specific objectives or hypotheses"

Item 3a (trial design)-We added a new item including this sub-item to clarify the basic trial design (such as parallel group, crossover, cluster) and the allocation ratio Item 3b (trial design)-We added a new sub-item that addresses any important changes to methods after trial commencement, with a discussion of reasons

Item 4 (participants)-Formerly item 3 in CONSORT 2001

Item 5 (interventions)-Formerly item 4 in CONSORT 2001. We encouraged greater specificity by stating that descriptions of interventions should include "sufficient details to allow replication" [3] Item 6 (outcomes)-We added a sub-item on identifying any changes to the primary and secondary outcome (endpoint) measures after the trial started. This followed from empirical evidence that authors frequently provide analyses of outcomes in their published papers that were not the prespecified primary and secondary outcomes in their protocols, while ignoring their prespecified outcomes (that is, selective outcome reporting) [4,22]. We eliminated text on any methods used to enhance the quality of measurements Item 9 (allocation concealment mechanism)-We reworded this to include mechanism in both the report topic and the descriptor to reinforce that authors should report the actual steps taken to ensure allocation concealment rather than simply report imprecise, perhaps banal, assurances of concealment Item 11 (blinding)-We added the specification of how blinding was done and, if relevant, a description of the similarity of interventions and procedures. We also eliminated text on "how the success of blinding (masking) was assessed" because of a lack of empirical evidence supporting the practice as well as theoretical concerns about the validity of any such assessment [23,24] Item 12a (statistical methods)-We added that statistical methods should also be provided for analysis of secondary outcomes Sub-item 14b (recruitment)-Based on empirical research, we added a sub-item on "Why the trial ended or was stopped" [25] Item 15 (baseline data)-We specified "A table" to clarify that baseline and clinical characteristics of each group are most clearly expressed in a table Item 16 (numbers analysed)-We replaced mention of "intention to treat" analysis, a widely misused term, by a more explicit request for information about retaining participants in their original assigned groups [26] Sub-item 17b (outcomes and estimation)-For appropriate clinical interpretability, prevailing experience suggested the addition of "For binary outcomes, presentation of both relative and absolute effect sizes is recommended" [27] Item 19 (harms)-We included a reference to the CON-SORT paper on harms [28] Item 20 (limitations)-We changed the topic from "Interpretation" and supplanted the prior text with a sentence focusing on the reporting of sources of potential bias and imprecision Item 22 (interpretation)-We changed the topic from "Overall evidence." Indeed, we understand that authors should be allowed leeway for interpretation under this nebulous heading. However, the CONSORT Group expressed concerns that conclusions in papers frequently misrepresented the actual analytical results and that harms were ignored or marginalised. Therefore, we changed the checklist item to include the concepts of results matching interpretations and of benefits being balanced with harms Item 23 (registration)-We added a new item on trial registration. Empirical evidence supports the need for trial registration, and recent requirements by journal editors have fostered compliance [29] Item 24 (protocol)-We added a new item on availability of the trial protocol. Empirical evidence suggests that authors often ignore, in the conduct and reporting of their trial, what they stated in the protocol [4,22]. Hence, availability of the protocol can instigate adherence to the protocol before publication and facilitate assessment of adherence after publication Item 25 (funding)-We added a new item on funding.

Authors, peer reviewers, and editors should vigilantly guard against that potential drawback and refer, for example, to trial protocols, to information on trial registers, and to regulatory agency websites. Moreover, the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing and conducting randomised trials. The items should elicit clear pronouncements of how and what the authors did, but do not contain any judgments on how and what the authors should have done. Thus, CONSORT 2010 is not intended as an instrument to evaluate the quality of a trial. Nor is it appropriate to use the checklist to construct a "quality score."
Nevertheless, we suggest that researchers begin trials with their end publication in mind. Poor reporting allows authors, intentionally or inadvertently, to escape scrutiny of any weak aspects of their trials. However, with wide adoption of CONSORT by journals and editorial groups, most authors should have to report transparently all important aspects of their trial. The ensuing scrutiny rewards well conducted trials and penalises poorly conducted trials. Thus, investigators should understand the CONSORT 2010 reporting guidelines before starting a trial as a further incentive to design and conduct their trials according to rigorous standards.
CONSORT 2010 supplants the prior version published in 2001. Any support for the earlier version accumulated from journals or editorial groups will automatically extend to this newer version, unless specifically requested otherwise. Journals that do not currently support CON-SORT may do so by registering on the CONSORT website. If a journal supports or endorses CONSORT 2010, it should cite one of the original versions of CONSORT 2010, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration, and the CONSORT website in their "Instructions to authors." We suggest that authors who wish to cite CON-SORT should cite this or another of the original journal versions of CONSORT 2010 Statement, and, if appropriate, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13]. All CONSORT material can be accessed through the original publishing journals or the CONSORT website. Groups or individuals who desire to translate the CON-SORT 2010 Statement into other languages should first consult the CONSORT policy statement on the website.
We emphasise that CONSORT 2010 represents an evolving guideline. It requires perpetual reappraisal and, if necessary, modifications. In the future we will further revise the CONSORT material considering comments, criticisms, experiences, and accumulating new evidence. We invite readers to submit recommendations via the CONSORT website.

Appendix 1: Noteworthy general changes in CONSORT 2010 Statement

• We simplified and clarified the wording, such as in items 1, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, and 21 • We improved consistency of style across the items by removing the imperative verbs that were in the 2001 version
• We enhanced specificity of appraisal by breaking some items into sub-items. Many journals expect authors to complete a CONSORT checklist indicating where in the manuscript the items have been addressed. Experience with the checklist noted pragmatic difficulties when an item comprised multiple elements. For example, item 4 addresses eligibility of participants and the settings and locations of data collection. With the 2001 version, an author could provide a page number for that item on the checklist, but might have reported only eligibility in the paper, for example, and not reported the settings and locations. CONSORT 2010 relieves obfuscations and forces authors to provide page numbers in the checklist for both eligibility and settings.

Appendix 2: Noteworthy specific changes in CONSORT 2010 Statement

Item 1b (title and abstract)-We added a sub-item on providing a structured summary of trial design, methods, results, and conclusions and referenced the CONSORT for abstracts article [21].

Item 2b (introduction)-We added a new sub-item (formerly item 5 in CONSORT 2001) on "Specific objectives or hypotheses"

Item 3a (trial design)-We added a new item including this sub-item to clarify the basic trial design (such as parallel group, crossover, cluster) and the allocation ratio Item 3b (trial design)-We added a new sub-item that addresses any important changes to methods after trial commencement, with a discussion of reasons

Item 4 (participants)-Formerly item 3 in CONSORT 2001

Item 5 (interventions)-Formerly item 4 in CONSORT 2001. We encouraged greater specificity by stating that descriptions of interventions should include "sufficient details to allow replication" [3] Item 6 (outcomes)-We added a sub-item on identifying any changes to the primary and secondary outcome (endpoint) measures after the trial started. This followed from empirical evidence that authors frequently provide analyses of outcomes in their published papers that were not the prespecified primary and secondary outcomes in their protocols, while ignoring their prespecified outcomes (that is, selective outcome reporting) [4,22]. We eliminated text on any methods used to enhance the quality of measurements Item 9 (allocation concealment mechanism)-We reworded this to include mechanism in both the report topic and the descriptor to reinforce that authors should report the actual steps taken to ensure allocation concealment rather than simply report imprecise, perhaps banal, assurances of concealment Item 11 (blinding)-We added the specification of how blinding was done and, if relevant, a description of the similarity of interventions and procedures. We also eliminated text on "how the success of blinding (masking) was assessed" because of a lack of empirical evidence supporting the practice as well as theoretical concerns about the validity of any such assessment [23,24] Item 12a (statistical methods)-We added that statistical methods should also be provided for analysis of secondary outcomes Sub-item 14b (recruitment)-Based on empirical research, we added a sub-item on "Why the trial ended or was stopped" [25] Item 15 (baseline data)-We specified "A table" to clarify that baseline and clinical characteristics of each group are most clearly expressed in a table Item 16 (numbers analysed)-We replaced mention of "intention to treat" analysis, a widely misused term, by a more explicit request for information about retaining participants in their original assigned groups [26] Sub-item 17b (outcomes and estimation)-For appropriate clinical interpretability, prevailing experience suggested the addition of "For binary outcomes, presentation of both relative and absolute effect sizes is recommended" [27] Item 19 (harms)-We included a reference to the CON-SORT paper on harms [28] Item 20 (limitations)-We changed the topic from "Interpretation" and supplanted the prior text with a sentence focusing on the reporting of sources of potential bias and imprecision Item 22 (interpretation)-We changed the topic from "Overall evidence." Indeed, we understand that authors should be allowed leeway for interpretation under this nebulous heading. However, the CONSORT Group expressed concerns that conclusions in papers frequently misrepresented the actual analytical results and that harms were ignored or marginalised. Therefore, we changed the checklist item to include the concepts of results matching interpretations and of benefits being balanced with harms Item 23 (registration)-We added a new item on trial registration. Empirical evidence supports the need for trial registration, and recent requirements by journal editors have fostered compliance [29] Item 24 (protocol)-We added a new item on availability of the trial protocol. Empirical evidence suggests that authors often ignore, in the conduct and reporting of their trial, what they stated in the protocol [4,22]. Hence, availability of the protocol can instigate adherence to the protocol before publication and facilitate assessment of adherence after publication Item 25 (funding)-We added a new item on funding. Empirical evidence points toward funding source sometimes being associated with estimatedeatment effects [30] Competing interests Uniform disclosure of potential conflicts of interest: all authors have completed the ICMJE unified competing interest form at http://www.icmje.org/ coi_disclosure.pdf (available from the corresponding author) and declare (1) DM received grants for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; KFS and DGA received support for travel to meetings for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; (2) KFS and DA had travel expenses reimbursed by the EQUATOR Network; KFS has received honoraria for delivering educational presentations for the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology Foundation for Excellence in Women's Health Care, Ortho-McNeil Janssen Scientific Affairs, and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology; and has done consultancy for Wyeth.

Members of the CONSORT Group attended the meeting, except for those noted below, and provided input on and review of the revised checklist and text of this article. Some members also prepared background material.

Introduction

Randomised controlled trials, when appropriately designed, conducted, and reported, represent the gold standard in evaluating healthcare interventions. However, randomised trials can yield biased results if they lack methodological rigour [1]. To assess a trial accurately, readers of a published report need complete, clear, and transparent information on its methodology and findings. Unfortunately, attempted assessments frequently fail because authors of many trial reports neglect to provide lucid and complete descriptions of that critical information [2][3][4].
That lack of adequate reporting fuelled the development of the original CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement in 1996 [5] and its revision five years later [6][7][8]. While those statements improved the reporting quality for some randomised controlled trials, [9,10] many trial reports still remain inadequate [2]. Furthermore, new methodological evidence and additional experience has accumulated since the last revision in 2001. Consequently, we organised a CONSORT Group meeting to update the 2001 statement [6][7][8]. We introduce here the result of that process, CONSORT 2010.

Intent of CONSORT 2010

The CONSORT 2010 Statement is this paper including the 25 item checklist in the table (Table 1) and the flow diagram ( Figure 1). It provides guidance for reporting all randomised controlled trials, but focuses on the most common design type-individually randomised, two group, parallel trials. Other trial designs, such as cluster randomised trials and non-inferiority trials, require varying amounts of additional information. CONSORT extensions for these designs, [11,12] and other CON-SORT products, can be found through the CONSORT website http://www.consort-statement.org. Along with the CONSORT statement, we have updated the explanation and elaboration article, [13] which explains the inclusion of each checklist item, provides methodological background, and gives published examples of transparent reporting.
Diligent adherence by authors to the checklist items facilitates clarity, completeness, and transparency of reporting. Explicit descriptions, not ambiguity or omission, best serve the interests of all readers. Note that the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing, conducting, and analysing trials. It solely addresses the reporting of what was done and what was found.
Nevertheless, CONSORT does indirectly affect design and conduct. Transparent reporting reveals deficiencies in research if they exist. Thus, investigators who conduct inadequate trials, but who must transparently report, should not be able to pass through the publication process without revelation of their trial's inadequacies. That emerging reality should provide impetus to improved trial design and conduct in the future, a secondary indirect goal of our work. Moreover, CONSORT can help researchers in designing their trial.  Background to CONSORT Efforts to improve the reporting of randomised controlled trials accelerated in the mid-1990s, spurred partly by methodological research. Researchers had shown for many years that authors reported such trials poorly, and empirical evidence began to accumulate that some poorly conducted or poorly reported aspects of trials were associated with bias [14]. Two initiatives aimed at developing reporting guidelines culminated in one of us (DM) and Drummond Rennie organising the first CONSORT statement in 1996 [5]. Further methodological research on similar topics reinforced earlier findings [15] and fed into the revision of 2001 [6][7][8]. Subsequently, the expanding body of methodological research informed the refinement of CONSORT 2010. More than 700 studies com-prise the CONSORT database (located on the CONSORT website), which provides the empirical evidence to underpin the CONSORT initiative. Indeed, CONSORT Group members continually monitor the literature. Information gleaned from these efforts provides an evidence base on which to update the CON-SORT statement. We add, drop, or modify items based on that evidence and the recommendations of the CON-SORT Group, an international and eclectic group of clinical trialists, statisticians, epidemiologists, and biomedical editors. The CONSORT Executive (KFS, DGA, DM) strives for a balance of established and emerging researchers. The membership of the group is dynamic. As our work expands in response to emerging projects and needed expertise, we invite new members to contribute. Sources of funding and other support (such as supply of drugs), role of funders *We strongly recommend reading this statement in conjunction with the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13] for important clarifications on all the items. If relevant, we also recommend reading CONSORT extensions for cluster randomised trials [11], non-inferiority and equivalence trials [12], non-pharmacological treatments [32], herbal interventions [33], and pragmatic trials [34]. Additional extensions are forthcoming: for those and for up to date references relevant to this checklist, see http://www.consort-statement.org.

Table 1: CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a randomised trial* (Continued)

As such, CONSORT continually assimilates new ideas and perspectives. That process informs the continually evolving CONSORT statement. Over time, CONSORT has garnered much support. More than 400 journals, published around the world and in many languages, have explicitly supported the CON-SORT statement. Many other healthcare journals support it without our knowledge. Moreover, thousands more have implicitly supported it with the endorsement of the CONSORT statement by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors http://www.icmje.org. Other prominent editorial groups, the Council of Science Editors and the World Association of Medical Editors, officially support CONSORT. That support seems warranted: when used by authors and journals, CON-SORT seems to improve reporting [9].

Development of CONSORT 2010

Thirty one members of the CONSORT 2010 Group met in Montebello, Canada, in January 2007 to update the 2001 CONSORT statement. In addition to the accumulating evidence relating to existing checklist items, several new issues had come to prominence since 2001. Some participants were given primary responsibility for aggre-gating and synthesising the relevant evidence on a particular checklist item of interest. Based on that evidence, the group deliberated the value of each item. As in prior CONSORT versions, we kept only those items deemed absolutely fundamental to reporting a randomised controlled trial. Moreover, an item may be fundamental to a trial but not included, such as approval by an institutional ethical review board, because funding bodies strictly enforce ethical review and medical journals usually address reporting ethical review in their instructions for authors. Other items may seem desirable, such as reporting on whether on-site monitoring was done, but a lack of empirical evidence or any consensus on their value cautions against inclusion at this point. The CONSORT 2010 Statement thus addresses the minimum criteria, although that should not deter authors from including other information if they consider it important.
After the meeting, the CONSORT Executive convened teleconferences and meetings to revise the checklist. After seven major iterations, a revised checklist was distributed to the larger group for feedback. With that feedback, the executive met twice in person to consider all the comments and to produce a penultimate version. That served as the basis for writing the first draft of this paper, which was then distributed to the group for feedback. After consideration of their comments, the executive finalised the statement.
The CONSORT Executive then drafted an updated explanation and elaboration manuscript, with assistance from other members of the larger group. The substance of the 2007 CONSORT meeting provided the material for the update. The updated explanation and elaboration manuscript was distributed to the entire group for additions, deletions, and changes. That final iterative process converged to the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13].

Changes in CONSORT 2010

The revision process resulted in evolutionary, not revolutionary, changes to the checklist (Table 1), and the flow diagram was not modified except for one word (Figure 1). Moreover, because other reporting guidelines augmenting the checklist refer to item numbers, we kept the existing items under their previous item numbers except for some renumbering of items 2 to 5. We added additional items either as a sub-item under an existing item, an entirely new item number at the end of the checklist, or (with item 3) an interjected item into a renumbered segment. We have summarised the noteworthy general changes in Appendix 1 and specific changes in Appendix 2. The CONSORT website contains a side by side comparison of the 2001 and 2010 versions.

Implications and limitations

We developed CONSORT 2010 to assist authors in writing reports of randomised controlled trials, editors and peer reviewers in reviewing manuscripts for publication, and readers in critically appraising published articles. The CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration provides elucidation and context to the checklist items. We strongly recommend using the explanation and elaboration in conjunction with the checklist to foster complete, clear, and transparent reporting and aid appraisal of published trial reports.
CONSORT 2010 focuses predominantly on the two group, parallel randomised controlled trial, which accounts for over half of trials in the literature [2]. Most of the items from the CONSORT 2010 Statement, however, pertain to all types of randomised trials. Nevertheless, some types of trials or trial situations dictate the need for additional information in the trial report. When in doubt, authors, editors, and readers should consult the CONSORT website for any CONSORT extensions, expansions (amplifications), implementations, or other guidance that may be relevant.
The evidence based approach we have used for CON-SORT also served as a model for development of other reporting guidelines, such as for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies evaluating interventions [16], diagnostic studies [17], and observational studies [18]. The explicit goal of all these initiatives is to improve reporting. The Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network will facilitate development of reporting guidelines and help disseminate the guidelines: http://www.equator-network.org provides information on all reporting guidelines in health research.
With CONSORT 2010, we again intentionally declined to produce a rigid structure for the reporting of randomised trials. Indeed, SORT [19] tried a rigid format, and it failed in a pilot run with an editor and authors [20]. Consequently, the format of articles should abide by journal style, editorial directions, the traditions of the research field addressed, and, where possible, author preferences. We do not wish to standardise the structure of reporting. Authors should simply address checklist items somewhere in the article, with ample detail and lucidity. That stated, we think that manuscripts benefit from frequent subheadings within the major sections, especially the methods and results sections.
CONSORT urges completeness, clarity, and transparency of reporting, which simply reflects the actual trial design and conduct. However, as a potential drawback, a reporting guideline might encourage some authors to report fictitiously the information suggested by the guidance rather than what was actually done. Authors, peer reviewers, and editors should vigilantly guard against that potential drawback and refer, for example, to trial protocols, to information on trial registers, and to regulatory agency websites. Moreover, the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing and conducting randomised trials. The items should elicit clear pronouncements of how and what the authors did, but do not contain any judgments on how and what the authors should have done. Thus, CONSORT 2010 is not intended as an instrument to evaluate the quality of a trial. Nor is it appropriate to use the checklist to construct a "quality score."
Nevertheless, we suggest that researchers begin trials with their end publication in mind. Poor reporting allows authors, intentionally or inadvertently, to escape scrutiny of any weak aspects of their trials. However, with wide adoption of CONSORT by journals and editorial groups, most authors should have to report transparently all important aspects of their trial. The ensuing scrutiny rewards well conducted trials and penalises poorly conducted trials. Thus, investigators should understand the CONSORT 2010 reporting guidelines before starting a trial as a further incentive to design and conduct their trials according to rigorous standards.
CONSORT 2010 supplants the prior version published in 2001. Any support for the earlier version accumulated from journals or editorial groups will automatically extend to this newer version, unless specifically requested otherwise. Journals that do not currently support CON-SORT may do so by registering on the CONSORT website. If a journal supports or endorses CONSORT 2010, it should cite one of the original versions of CONSORT 2010, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration, and the CONSORT website in their "Instructions to authors." We suggest that authors who wish to cite CON-SORT should cite this or another of the original journal versions of CONSORT 2010 Statement, and, if appropriate, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13]. All CONSORT material can be accessed through the original publishing journals or the CONSORT website. Groups or individuals who desire to translate the CON-SORT 2010 Statement into other languages should first consult the CONSORT policy statement on the website.
We emphasise that CONSORT 2010 represents an evolving guideline. It requires perpetual reappraisal and, if necessary, modifications. In the future we will further revise the CONSORT material considering comments, criticisms, experiences, and accumulating new evidence. We invite readers to submit recommendations via the CONSORT website.

Intent of CONSORT 2010

The CONSORT 2010 Statement is this paper including the 25 item checklist in the table (Table 1) and the flow diagram ( Figure 1). It provides guidance for reporting all randomised controlled trials, but focuses on the most common design type-individually randomised, two group, parallel trials.

Development of CONSORT 2010

Thirty one members of the CONSORT 2010 Group met in Montebello, Canada, in January 2007 to update the 2001 CONSORT statement. In addition to the accumulating evidence relating to existing checklist items, several new issues had come to prominence since 2001. Some participants were given primary responsibility for aggre-gating and synthesising the relevant evidence on a particular checklist item of interest. Based on that evidence, the group deliberated the value of each item. As in prior CONSORT versions, we kept only those items deemed absolutely fundamental to reporting a randomised controlled trial. Moreover, an item may be fundamental to a trial but not included, such as approval by an institutional ethical review board, because funding bodies strictly enforce ethical review and medical journals usually address reporting ethical review in their instructions for authors. Other items may seem desirable, such as reporting on whether on-site monitoring was done, but a lack of empirical evidence or any consensus on their value cautions against inclusion at this point. The CONSORT 2010 Statement thus addresses the minimum criteria, although that should not deter authors from including other information if they consider it important.
After the meeting, the CONSORT Executive convened teleconferences and meetings to revise the checklist. After seven major iterations, a revised checklist was distributed to the larger group for feedback. With that feedback, the executive met twice in person to consider all the comments and to produce a penultimate version. That served as the basis for writing the first draft of this paper, which was then distributed to the group for feedback. After consideration of their comments, the executive finalised the statement.
The CONSORT Executive then drafted an updated explanation and elaboration manuscript, with assistance from other members of the larger group. The substance of the 2007 CONSORT meeting provided the material for the update. The updated explanation and elaboration manuscript was distributed to the entire group for additions, deletions, and changes. That final iterative process converged to the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13].

Changes in CONSORT 2010

The revision process resulted in evolutionary, not revolutionary, changes to the checklist (Table 1), and the flow diagram was not modified except for one word (Figure 1). Moreover, because other reporting guidelines augmenting the checklist refer to item numbers, we kept the existing items under their previous item numbers except for some renumbering of items 2 to 5. We added additional items either as a sub-item under an existing item, an entirely new item number at the end of the checklist, or (with item 3) an interjected item into a renumbered segment. We have summarised the noteworthy general changes in Appendix 1 and specific changes in Appendix 2. The CONSORT website contains a side by side comparison of the 2001 and 2010 versions.

Implications and limitations

We developed CONSORT 2010 to assist authors in writing reports of randomised controlled trials, editors and peer reviewers in reviewing manuscripts for publication, and readers in critically appraising published articles. The CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration provides elucidation and context to the checklist items. We strongly recommend using the explanation and elaboration in conjunction with the checklist to foster complete, clear, and transparent reporting and aid appraisal of published trial reports.
CONSORT 2010 focuses predominantly on the two group, parallel randomised controlled trial, which accounts for over half of trials in the literature [2]. Most of the items from the CONSORT 2010 Statement, however, pertain to all types of randomised trials. Nevertheless, some types of trials or trial situations dictate the need for additional information in the trial report. When in doubt, authors, editors, and readers should consult the CONSORT website for any CONSORT extensions, expansions (amplifications), implementations, or other guidance that may be relevant.
The evidence based approach we have used for CON-SORT also served as a model for development of other reporting guidelines, such as for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of studies evaluating interventions [16], diagnostic studies [17], and observational studies [18]. The explicit goal of all these initiatives is to improve reporting. The Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network will facilitate development of reporting guidelines and help disseminate the guidelines: http://www.equator-network.org provides information on all reporting guidelines in health research.
With CONSORT 2010, we again intentionally declined to produce a rigid structure for the reporting of randomised trials. Indeed, SORT [19] tried a rigid format, and it failed in a pilot run with an editor and authors [20]. Consequently, the format of articles should abide by journal style, editorial directions, the traditions of the research field addressed, and, where possible, author preferences. We do not wish to standardise the structure of reporting. Authors should simply address checklist items somewhere in the article, with ample detail and lucidity. That stated, we think that manuscripts benefit from frequent subheadings within the major sections, especially the methods and results sections.
CONSORT urges completeness, clarity, and transparency of reporting, which simply reflects the actual trial design and conduct. However, as a potential drawback, a reporting guideline might encourage some authors to report fictitiously the information suggested by the guidance rather than what was actually done. Authors, peer reviewers, and editors should vigilantly guard against that potential drawback and refer, for example, to trial protocols, to information on trial registers, and to regulatory agency websites. Moreover, the CONSORT 2010 Statement does not include recommendations for designing and conducting randomised trials. The items should elicit clear pronouncements of how and what the authors did, but do not contain any judgments on how and what the authors should have done. Thus, CONSORT 2010 is not intended as an instrument to evaluate the quality of a trial. Nor is it appropriate to use the checklist to construct a "quality score."
Nevertheless, we suggest that researchers begin trials with their end publication in mind. Poor reporting allows authors, intentionally or inadvertently, to escape scrutiny of any weak aspects of their trials. However, with wide adoption of CONSORT by journals and editorial groups, most authors should have to report transparently all important aspects of their trial. The ensuing scrutiny rewards well conducted trials and penalises poorly conducted trials. Thus, investigators should understand the CONSORT 2010 reporting guidelines before starting a trial as a further incentive to design and conduct their trials according to rigorous standards.
CONSORT 2010 supplants the prior version published in 2001. Any support for the earlier version accumulated from journals or editorial groups will automatically extend to this newer version, unless specifically requested otherwise. Journals that do not currently support CON-SORT may do so by registering on the CONSORT website. If a journal supports or endorses CONSORT 2010, it should cite one of the original versions of CONSORT 2010, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration, and the CONSORT website in their "Instructions to authors." We suggest that authors who wish to cite CON-SORT should cite this or another of the original journal versions of CONSORT 2010 Statement, and, if appropriate, the CONSORT 2010 Explanation and Elaboration [13]. All CONSORT material can be accessed through the original publishing journals or the CONSORT website. Groups or individuals who desire to translate the CON-SORT 2010 Statement into other languages should first consult the CONSORT policy statement on the website.
We emphasise that CONSORT 2010 represents an evolving guideline. It requires perpetual reappraisal and, if necessary, modifications. In the future we will further revise the CONSORT material considering comments, criticisms, experiences, and accumulating new evidence. We invite readers to submit recommendations via the CONSORT website.

Appendix 1: Noteworthy general changes in CONSORT 2010 Statement

• We simplified and clarified the wording, such as in items 1, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, and 21 • We improved consistency of style across the items by removing the imperative verbs that were in the 2001 version
• We enhanced specificity of appraisal by breaking some items into sub-items. Many journals expect authors to complete a CONSORT checklist indicating where in the manuscript the items have been addressed. Experience with the checklist noted pragmatic difficulties when an item comprised multiple elements. For example, item 4 addresses eligibility of participants and the settings and locations of data collection. With the 2001 version, an author could provide a page number for that item on the checklist, but might have reported only eligibility in the paper, for example, and not reported the settings and locations. CONSORT 2010 relieves obfuscations and forces authors to provide page numbers in the checklist for both eligibility and settings.

Appendix 2: Noteworthy specific changes in CONSORT 2010 Statement

Item 1b (title and abstract)-We added a sub-item on providing a structured summary of trial design, methods, results, and conclusions and referenced the CONSORT for abstracts article [21].

Item 2b (introduction)-We added a new sub-item (formerly item 5 in CONSORT 2001) on "Specific objectives or hypotheses"

Item 3a (trial design)-We added a new item including this sub-item to clarify the basic trial design (such as parallel group, crossover, cluster) and the allocation ratio Item 3b (trial design)-We added a new sub-item that addresses any important changes to methods after trial commencement, with a discussion of reasons

Item 4 (participants)-Formerly item 3 in CONSORT 2001

Item 5 (interventions)-Formerly item 4 in CONSORT 2001. We encouraged greater specificity by stating that descriptions of interventions should include "sufficient details to allow replication" [3] Item 6 (outcomes)-We added a sub-item on identifying any changes to the primary and secondary outcome (endpoint) measures after the trial started. This followed from empirical evidence that authors frequently provide analyses of outcomes in their published papers that were not the prespecified primary and secondary outcomes in their protocols, while ignoring their prespecified outcomes (that is, selective outcome reporting) [4,22]. We eliminated text on any methods used to enhance the quality of measurements Item 9 (allocation concealment mechanism)-We reworded this to include mechanism in both the report topic and the descriptor to reinforce that authors should report the actual steps taken to ensure allocation concealment rather than simply report imprecise, perhaps banal, assurances of concealment Item 11 (blinding)-We added the specification of how blinding was done and, if relevant, a description of the similarity of interventions and procedures. We also eliminated text on "how the success of blinding (masking) was assessed" because of a lack of empirical evidence supporting the practice as well as theoretical concerns about the validity of any such assessment [23,24] Item 12a (statistical methods)-We added that statistical methods should also be provided for analysis of secondary outcomes Sub-item 14b (recruitment)-Based on empirical research, we added a sub-item on "Why the trial ended or was stopped" [25] Item 15 (baseline data)-We specified "A table" to clarify that baseline and clinical characteristics of each group are most clearly expressed in a table Item 16 (numbers analysed)-We replaced mention of "intention to treat" analysis, a widely misused term, by a more explicit request for information about retaining participants in their original assigned groups [26] Sub-item 17b (outcomes and estimation)-For appropriate clinical interpretability, prevailing experience suggested the addition of "For binary outcomes, presentation of both relative and absolute effect sizes is recommended" [27] Item 19 (harms)-We included a reference to the CON-SORT paper on harms [28] Item 20 (limitations)-We changed the topic from "Interpretation" and supplanted the prior text with a sentence focusing on the reporting of sources of potential bias and imprecision Item 22 (interpretation)-We changed the topic from "Overall evidence." Indeed, we understand that authors should be allowed leeway for interpretation under this nebulous heading. However, the CONSORT Group expressed concerns that conclusions in papers frequently misrepresented the actual analytical results and that harms were ignored or marginalised. Therefore, we changed the checklist item to include the concepts of results matching interpretations and of benefits being balanced with harms Item 23 (registration)-We added a new item on trial registration. Empirical evidence supports the need for trial registration, and recent requirements by journal editors have fostered compliance [29] Item 24 (protocol)-We added a new item on availability of the trial protocol. Empirical evidence suggests that authors often ignore, in the conduct and reporting of their trial, what they stated in the protocol [4,22]. Hence, availability of the protocol can instigate adherence to the protocol before publication and facilitate assessment of adherence after publication Item 25 (funding)-We added a new item on funding. Empirical evidence points toward funding source sometimes being associated with estimatedeatment effects [30] Competing interests Uniform disclosure of potential conflicts of interest: all authors have completed the ICMJE unified competing interest form at http://www.icmje.org/ coi_disclosure.pdf (available from the corresponding author) and declare (1) DM received grants for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; KFS and DGA received support for travel to meetings for this work from Johnson & Johnson, BMJ, and American Society for Clinical Oncology; (2) KFS and DA had travel expenses reimbursed by the EQUATOR Network; KFS has received honoraria for delivering educational presentations for the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology Foundation for Excellence in Women's Health Care, Ortho-McNeil Janssen Scientific Affairs, and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology; and has done consultancy for Wyeth.
