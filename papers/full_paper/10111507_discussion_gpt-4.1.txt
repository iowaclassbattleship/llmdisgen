**Discussion**

The present study provides new insight into the functional diversity of anti-CD138 monoclonal antibodies used for the detection of human plasma cells, with particular focus on the comparative performance of B-A38 and DL-101 clones. The findings demonstrate clear differences in staining capacity among the five commonly used anti-CD138 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) across human myeloma cell lines, in vitro generated plasma cells, and primary human bone marrow samples. Notably, the DL-101 clone detects a distinct subset of cells not captured by B-A38, suggesting previously unappreciated heterogeneity in syndecan-1 (CD138) display on human plasma cells.

**Antibody Recognition and Epitope Diversity**

The superior stain index of B-A38 compared to DL-101 on RPMI-8226 cells indicates that these clones recognize different epitopes or protein conformation states of syndecan-1/CD138. The DL-101 mAb was raised against recombinant syndecan-1 and specifically targets the native ectodomain, while B-A38 recognizes epitopes likely present on both core protein and glycosaminoglycan-decorated forms. The results that DL-101 binding is less efficient on certain cell lines and on in vitro differentiated B cells, and yet highly stable upon fixation, argue that post-translational modifications—most notably glycosylation and heparan/chondroitin sulfate chain addition—modulate the availability of the DL-101 epitope. This is consistent with previous structural and functional work showing extensive heterogeneity in syndecan-1 glycanation and molecular weight across cell types and developmental stages {{44421823}}.

**Detection of Distinct Human Plasma Cell Populations**

A key finding is that DL-101, unlike B-A38 and other conventional clones (B-B4, MI-15, 1D4), identifies a larger proportion of CD138^+ cells in in vitro-generated plasma cells, and marks a subset not labeled by B-A38 (BA^neg DL^+). These data imply the co-existence of at least two discernible syndecan-1^+ plasma cell populations during human B cell differentiation. Furthermore, the inability of DL-101 to efficiently label SKW6.4 (CD138^lo) cells suggests that specific glycosaminoglycan modifications may shield the DL-101-reactive epitope, supporting the idea that plasma cell heterogeneity encompasses not only differentiation state but also CD138 surface biochemistry. The observed lack of unspecific binding by DL-101 to unrelated cell populations reinforces its specificity.

**Implications for In Vitro Plasma Cell Models and Antibody Choice**

Given the wide use of CD138 staining to define terminally-differentiated plasma cells in both research and clinical settings (reviewed in {{4696579}}), these results underscore the importance of antibody selection. DL-101 mAb consistently identified a higher percentage of CD138^+ cells after in vitro differentiation, but a lower stain index compared to B-A38 even after careful titration, suggesting that while DL-101 increases sensitivity for some plasma cell subsets, it may not provide optimal signal-to-noise for quantitative applications. This heterogeneity was also detected in ex vivo bone marrow plasma cells, where both epitopes were present but to different extents, further suggesting that antibody clone can meaningfully impact apparent cell subset composition and, by extension, study conclusions.

**Relevance to Syndecan-1 Biology and the Wound Healing Context**

The existence of functionally and structurally distinct syndecan-1 populations has been reported in other physiological settings. For instance, soluble syndecan-1 ectodomains—recognizable by DL-101—are generated during inflammation and wound healing and play a role in modulating proteolytic balance in the extracellular environment {{22068922}}. The ability of syndecan-1 to be cleaved and shed, forming bioactive ectodomains, suggests that plasma cells with different syndecan-1 glycoforms may possess altered susceptibility to proteolysis, shedding, or interaction with growth factors and cytokines. This may have relevance for plasma cell survival, migration, or function in both steady-state immunity and pathological conditions.

**Limitations and Future Directions**

Several limitations merit mention. First, the study did not directly characterize the molecular forms of syndecan-1 recognized by DL-101 versus B-A38, nor elucidate the exact glycosylation differences responsible for differential antibody recognition. Mass spectrometry or epitope mapping would be informative next steps. Second, while DL-101 marks a larger and partially non-overlapping plasma cell subset in vitro, it is unclear whether these represent physiologically distinct maturation stages, functional states, or simply biochemically modified forms of the same cell type. Functional studies are needed to resolve this. Third, the potential relevance of DL-101^+BA-A38^neg plasma cells for disease states (e.g., multiple myeloma, autoimmune disease) or response to therapy was not addressed and should be explored.

**Conclusion**

In summary, this work shows that the DL-101 and B-A38 anti-CD138 mAbs identify overlapping but distinct plasma cell subsets both in vitro and in primary tissues, likely reflecting endogenous heterogeneity in syndecan-1 glycosylation and processing. These findings advise caution in the comparison of data across studies employing different CD138 antibodies, and suggest that combinatorial antibody strategies may provide a more comprehensive view of plasma cell heterogeneity. Further biochemical and functional characterization of the distinct syndecan-1^+ plasma cells is warranted to elucidate their roles in health and disease.
