The present study reports significant advances in the development and in vivo implantation of a glucose biofuel cell (GBFC) based on compressed carbon nanotube (CNT)-enzyme bioelectrodes, which successfully generated electrical power from physiological glucose and oxygen in the extracellular fluid of rats. This work builds upon earlier attempts to harness glucose oxidation coupled with oxygen reduction for implantable power sources but overcomes major limitations related to low power density, poor specificity, and enzyme/catalyst stability under physiological conditions.

A key element enabling these advances is the use of CNT-based bioelectrodes allowing efficient direct electron transfer with immobilized enzymes—glucose oxidase (GOx) at the anode and laccase at the cathode—and mechanical confinement of enzymes and redox mediators within a highly porous and conductive matrix. Such design provides both enhanced electrical wiring and improved substrate diffusion, which translate into a high open-circuit voltage (510–660 mV) and meaningful power outputs sustained over several minutes and multiple discharge cycles in vivo. Importantly, the GBFCs demonstrated the capacity to recover voltage after discharge, indicating a reversible and stable operation under intermittent power demands akin to those expected in medical devices.

Compared to prior biocatalytic systems employing traditional noble-metal catalysts or abiotic electrodes with poor oxygen reduction characteristics, the choice of laccase for cathodic oxygen reduction is notable. Although laccase activity is reduced relative to its optimal acidic pH, the enzyme nonetheless retained sufficient activity at physiological pH 7.0, despite minor chloride ion inhibition, as confirmed in supplementary studies. The mechanical confinement method contrasts with covalent enzyme immobilization strategies, providing a facile, low-cost approach adaptable to diverse enzymes and mediators compatible with the extracellular fluid environment.

The in vivo implantation strategy, situating the GBFC within the rat retroperitoneal space where glucose (~5 mM) and oxygen (~45 μM) concentrations mirror blood levels, ensured continuous substrate availability. The device’s biocompatibility was demonstrated by limited fibrotic encapsulation and neo-vascularization over implantation times up to 110 days without apparent adverse impact on animal weight or food intake, although electrical connectivity degraded after approximately 9 days. This highlights a critical challenge for long-term stable implantation, namely maintaining reliable electrical contacts and preventing biofouling or mechanical disconnection.

Functionally, the implanted GBFC proved capable of powering practical electronic devices including a light-emitting diode (LED) and a commercial digital thermometer via a dedicated low-voltage boost converter and energy storage capacitor. The intermittent activation of devices through capacitor charging and discharging cycles is particularly congruent with low-level, duty-cycled operation scenarios typical in implantable biosensors and monitoring systems. Although the continuous power output remains limited (~9.3×10⁻²³ J over 10 minutes at 150 µA/cm²), this study provides a proof of concept that enzymatic glucose biofuel cells can serve as viable micro-power supplies in vivo.

When contextualizing these findings in relation to previous literature, the reported power densities and operational stabilities represent a meaningful improvement over early implantable GBFCs, which often suffered from low power output or rapid enzymatic degradation. Furthermore, the ability to achieve direct electron transfer with CNT-based electrodes addresses the common bottleneck of mediator diffusion limitations and electrode fouling. The use of catalase alongside GOx minimizes hydrogen peroxide accumulation, protecting enzyme activity and enhancing stability—an important consideration for chronic implantation. 

Limitations remain, particularly regarding long-term durability under physiological conditions, stable device integration without loss of connection, and scale-up of power density to meet the higher energy demands of complex implantable devices such as robotic urinary sphincters or artificial kidneys. Advances in electrode miniaturization, integration of more robust enzymes or enzyme mimetics, improved encapsulation materials, and optimized bioelectronic interface designs will be needed to approach clinically relevant power levels (tens to hundreds of milliwatts). Additionally, strategies for continuous removal of reaction byproducts and prevention of immune responses merit further exploration.

In summary, this study provides compelling evidence that mechanically confined CNT-enzyme bioelectrodes can function as implantable glucose biofuel cells, producing stable electrical power in vivo sufficient for operating small biomedical electronics. These results substantiate the potential of GBFCs as a sustainable, self-powered platform for the next generation of implantable medical devices, circumventing the limitations inherent to conventional batteries and intermittent energy harvesting modalities. Future work focused on augmenting power output, long-term biocompatibility, and integration with low-power electronics will be critical to translating GBFC technology into clinical practice.
