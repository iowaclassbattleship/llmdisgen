The present study provides compelling evidence that skeletal muscle cells exert a potent trophic influence on spinal cord (SC) neurons in vitro, significantly enhancing the activity of choline acetyltransferase (CAT), a key enzyme in acetylcholine synthesis. The marked and time-dependent increase of CAT activity observed in SC-muscle co-cultures, in contrast to SC cells grown alone, underscores the specificity and robustness of this cell-cell interaction. Importantly, this effect did not extend to other enzymatic activities or general cell survival markers, indicating a selective upregulation of cholinergic phenotype rather than a nonspecific enhancement of cell viability or proliferation.

The stimulation of CAT activity by muscle was shown to be dose-dependent with respect to both SC and muscle cell numbers, revealing saturable capacity in SC neurons, yet no saturation was achieved with increasing muscle doses, suggesting that the muscle-derived factor(s) may be produced in limiting amounts or that multiple regulatory mechanisms are involved. The absence of requirement for dorsal root ganglion cells in facilitating this effect clarifies that the observed enhancement is attributable primarily to muscle-neuron interactions, rather than indirect involvement of sensory neuron populations.

The contrasting regulation of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity, an enzyme involved in inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesis, which was either unaffected or decreased in co-culture, indicates divergent and possibly reciprocal regulatory mechanisms acting on distinct neurotransmitter systems within SC neurons in response to muscle-derived signals. This differential enzymatic response further argues against nonspecific effects such as increased cell survival or plating efficiency and supports a specific induction of cholinergic properties.

The ability of muscle-conditioned medium (CM) to mimic the CAT stimulating effect establishes that muscle cells release diffusible trophic factor(s) responsible for enhancing the cholinergic phenotype in SC cultures. The linear dose-dependent response of SC cultures to varying concentrations of CM, as well as the additive effect observed when CM and co-culture were combined, suggests either multiple independent signaling pathways or that the ligand-receptor interaction has not reached saturation under the experimental conditions. Notably, the increase in CAT activity was achieved even when functional neuromuscular transmission was blocked by α-bungarotoxin, indicating that synaptic activity is not a prerequisite for the muscle-induced molecular changes in SC neurons, and pointing toward a trophic, rather than activity-dependent, mechanism.

Physical characterization of the active muscle-released factor(s) revealed thermal stability to 58°C and retention of activity after dialysis, suggesting it is a relatively large, heat-stable macromolecule not freely diffusible through membranes with a nominal cutoff of 50,000 daltons. The concentration and fractionation studies further indicate that the active component(s) are high molecular weight macromolecules, potentially proteins or glycoproteins. The ability to isolate this activity from serum-free muscle CM enhances the prospects for future purification and biochemical identification of the responsible trophic factors.

Taken together, these findings align with and extend previous observations in developmental neurobiology highlighting the reciprocal interactions between neurons and target tissues. The in vitro co-culture approach utilized herein circumvents the complexity of in vivo environments, enabling the delineation of specific muscle-derived signals that promote cholinergic differentiation or maintenance. This work suggests that skeletal muscle provides trophic support via secreted macromolecules that selectively upregulate CAT activity in spinal neurons, which may contribute to the establishment and refinement of functional neuromuscular junctions.

Future studies should aim to identify the molecular identity of the muscle-derived trophic factor(s), determine their receptor mechanisms on SC neurons, and define the intracellular signaling pathways mediating CAT upregulation. Additionally, investigation into whether similar factors influence other aspects of neuronal differentiation or synapse formation, and the relationship of these findings to in vivo development and regeneration, will be crucial. Understanding these trophic interactions may ultimately inform therapeutic strategies for neuromuscular diseases and injury.
