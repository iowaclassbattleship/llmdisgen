The analysis presented in this work sheds light on the intricate relationship between classical solutions of the Euclidean O(3) non-linear sigma model (NLSM) and their counterparts in the Pohlmeyer reduced theory, described here by the sinh-Gordon equation. The main findings revolve around the classification of solutions—instantons, merons, and elliptic solutions—and how these map under the non-local transformation characteristic of Pohlmeyer reduction.

Instanton solutions, characterized by integer topological charge and finite action, are shown to possess a vanishing stress-energy tensor. This property leads to a fundamental obstruction in performing Pohlmeyer reduction for such configurations, as the reduction requires a non-vanishing, real, and positive component of the stress-energy tensor to define the reduced field ϕ. Consequently, instantons do not have direct images within the sinh-Gordon framework, highlighting a key limitation of the reduced description in capturing the full topological spectrum of the original sigma model.

Meron solutions, exhibiting half-integer topological charge and singular behavior, deform the plane into one-dimensional submanifolds of the target sphere and have non-zero stress-energy tensors of a specific form. Through an appropriate conformal transformation, their stress-energy tensor components can be normalized to a positive constant µ², thereby enabling Pohlmeyer reduction. Remarkably, all meron configurations collapse to the trivial ground state of the sinh-Gordon equation in the reduced formulation. This finding suggests that the rich singular structure and fractional topological features of merons are not distinctly resolved in the reduced theory but rather correspond to a unique vacuum solution, underscoring a degeneracy induced by the reduction process.

The elliptic solutions serve as an intermediate class, interpolating smoothly between the meron and instanton limits. These solutions depend on an energy parameter E characterizing a mechanical analogy as a pendulum problem. By exploiting the flexibility of conformal transformations, the authors fix the mass scale µ consistently across solutions, enabling a uniform comparison in the reduced theory. The elliptic family splits into periodic (E < 0) and quasi-periodic (E > 0) subclasses, each mapping onto one-dimensional solutions of the sinh-Gordon equation depending on either the real or imaginary part of the reduced coordinate.

A notable and nontrivial insight arises from the identification that for every energy level E₁ in the periodic elliptic class, there exists a corresponding energy level E₂ in the quasi-periodic class such that E₁ and E₂ map onto the same solution of the reduced sinh-Gordon equation. From the modular properties of Jacobi elliptic functions, this correspondence is understood as a modular transformation relating the elliptic moduli of the two classes. Despite their distinct geometric realizations in the original sigma model—with periodic solutions covering partial regions of the target sphere and quasi-periodic solutions covering the entire sphere with singularities—their equivalence in the reduced theory emphasizes the nonlocal and gauge-like character of Pohlmeyer reduction that identifies seemingly distinct classical configurations.

This degeneracy in the mapping elucidates both the strengths and the limitations of the Pohlmeyer reduction approach: it simplifies the infinite-dimensional problem to an integrable scalar field equation but at the cost of losing some geometric and topological distinctions present in the original theory. This is consistent with the observed failure of instantons to be captured explicitly. Furthermore, the particular identification of solutions related by modular transformations reflects the deep interplay between the analytic structures in the original and reduced models.

The study also clarifies that the reduced theory solutions generated in this way reside in special subspaces of the sinh-Gordon equation solutions, namely those depending on a single real coordinate. This restriction arises naturally from the ansatz and the structure of the original elliptic solutions, suggesting avenues for exploring more general solutions that depend on both coordinates to fully capture the sigma model dynamics.

Overall, the work advances understanding of how classical singular and nonsingular configurations of the Euclidean O(3) sigma model manifest in the Pohlmeyer reduced framework, providing a concrete mapping that elucidates structural features of both theories. These results have implications for the analysis of integrable systems related to sigma models, the study of non-perturbative phenomena such as confinement, and the geometric interpretation of reductions employed in the AdS/CFT correspondence context. Future work may involve extending the correspondence to more general symmetric spaces, exploring quantum effects, or relaxing the ansatz restrictions to capture a broader class of solutions in the reduced integrable systems.
