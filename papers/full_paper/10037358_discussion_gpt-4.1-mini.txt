The VAPrapid-2 study protocol addresses a critical clinical and antimicrobial stewardship challenge in intensive care units (ICUs): the overuse of antibiotics driven by the difficulty in accurately and rapidly diagnosing ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP). The high empirical antibiotic usage associated with suspected VAP, despite confirmation of infection in only about 40% of suspected cases, reflects the diagnostic uncertainty and the significant clinical risk of under-treatment. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) builds on prior observational and validation studies demonstrating that bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid biomarkers, particularly interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and interleukin-8 (IL-8), can reliably exclude VAP within a clinically actionable timeframe.

The primary objective is to assess whether integrating a rapid biomarker-based rule-out test using BAL IL-1β and IL-8 concentrations, analyzed by cytometric bead array within approximately 6 hours, can reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure as measured by antibiotic-free days (AFD) in the week following BAL. The study design includes 210 adult ICU patients with clinically suspected VAP randomized to either standard care or standard care plus biomarker-guided antibiotic recommendations based on the assay results. This multicenter approach across 22 ICUs ensures broad applicability and generalizability across diverse ICU populations and settings within the NHS framework.

The rigor of the trial is underscored by standardized BAL procedures, strict inclusion/exclusion criteria to minimize risk and ensure patient safety, and robust laboratory quality control protocols for biomarker assay performance. The choice of BAL sampling, despite inherent challenges related to patient stability and procedural risk, is justified by its high specificity for sampling affected alveolar regions, which is critical given the patchy nature of VAP pathology and limits of non-bronchoscopic methods. Moreover, the assay’s rapid turnaround offers a practical tool to inform earlier antibiotic discontinuation decisions than traditional culture-based diagnostics, which typically require 48–72 hours.

Key strengths include the pragmatic nature of the trial; clinical decisions regarding antibiotic use remain at the clinician’s discretion following biomarker results, thus reflecting real-world practice and maintaining patient safety by allowing antibiotic re-initiation if clinically warranted. The primary outcome incorporates a meaningful measure of antibiotic stewardship impact, while secondary outcomes further evaluate clinical and safety endpoints including mortality, ventilator-free days, organ failure scores, ICU/hospital length of stay, and rates of resistant infections.

Potential limitations acknowledged in the study design include the exclusion of patients too unstable for BAL, which may limit extrapolation to all ICU populations; considerable antibiotic use prior to BAL, which could influence biomarker levels and microbiological culture sensitivity, although sub-analyses suggest minimal impact; and the imperfect reference standard for VAP diagnosis based on BAL culture thresholds that may miss some infections or detect colonization. Additionally, the study addresses the trade-off between maximizing negative predictive value to confidently exclude VAP and reduced specificity, which could limit biomarker impact in ruling out infection for some patients.

This trial fills a critical evidence gap by moving beyond diagnostic accuracy to investigate the clinical utility of biomarker-guided management on antibiotic exposure in suspected VAP. If successful, this approach has the potential to safely diminish unnecessary antibiotic use in ICU settings, thereby contributing substantially to antimicrobial stewardship efforts and mitigating the rise of antibiotic resistance. The planned parallel process evaluation will provide valuable insights into factors influencing implementation, uptake, and clinician adherence, which are essential for future translation into routine practice.

In conclusion, the VAPrapid-2 RCT is a methodologically robust, clinically relevant study designed to assess whether rapid exclusion of VAP using BAL fluid IL-1β and IL-8 biomarkers can safely reduce antibiotic use in critically ill ventilated patients. Its findings will inform ICU antibiotic stewardship strategies and may represent a significant advance in personalized infection management in critical care.
