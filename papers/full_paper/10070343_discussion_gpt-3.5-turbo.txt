The study aimed to investigate the impact of participation in the Mind Body Medicine (MBM) program at Georgetown University School of Medicine on empathy, stress, and depression in medical students. The results showed that medical students experienced increased stress levels and decreased empathy during their first year of medical school. However, participation in the MBM course did not alter this inverse relationship between stress and empathy. Interestingly, the study found that depression scores increased significantly in the control group but not in students who took the MBM course. This pilot study provides valuable information for future studies examining the effects of MBM interventions on medical students' well-being. While the study has some limitations, it sheds light on the importance of addressing stress, depression, and empathy in medical education to foster compassionate and competent physicians.

This discussion highlights the importance of programs focused on promoting well-being and coping strategies for medical students to combat stress, depression, and empathy decline during medical training. The results emphasize the need for further research and interventions to support the mental health and professional development of medical students.
