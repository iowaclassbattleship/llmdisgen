**Discussion**

The present study aimed to determine whether participation in an 11-week Mind Body Medicine (MBM) course could influence first-year medical students’ levels of empathy, stress, and depression during their initial year of training. Consistent with prior literature, our findings demonstrate that both perceived stress and depressive symptoms increased, while self-reported empathy declined across the first year of medical school, regardless of MBM course participation. Importantly, however, the increase in depression was statistically significant only among control students, suggesting a potential protective effect of MBM on depressive symptoms, but not on perceived stress or empathy.

The decline in empathy observed in both MBM and control groups is concordant with previous research documenting similar trends among medical students as they progress through their education {{5632524}}, supporting the robustness of this phenomenon across different settings and cohorts. While some have hypothesized that curricular interventions may buffer against the erosion of empathy {{not_in_s2orc}}, our data indicate that the MBM course, as currently implemented, did not prevent this decline. It is notable that baseline and post-intervention empathy scores did not differ significantly between groups, paralleling findings from other institutions where various empathy-promoting curricula have failed to yield measurable improvements in self-assessed empathy using validated scales such as the JSPE-S {{7595451}}.

One explanation for this limited effect may relate to the multidimensional nature of empathy and its vulnerability to a range of personal and environmental factors. Studies have consistently shown that burnout, depersonalization, and diminished sense of personal accomplishment are strongly inversely correlated with empathy {{5632524}}. Although we did not directly measure burnout, it is possible that the persistent increase in stress across both groups contributed to the observed empathy decline. The lack of impact of MBM participation on stress trajectories suggests that the intervention, while beneficial for certain aspects of well-being, may not sufficiently counteract the entrenched stressors present in the medical education environment. This is consistent with larger multicenter studies indicating that distress and well-being are strong predictors of empathy {{5632524}}, and that relatively brief curricular interventions may have limited capacity to overcome systemic or cultural challenges.

In contrast, MBM participation appeared to mitigate the increase in depressive symptoms, as only the control group showed a statistically significant rise in PHQ scores by year’s end. Although the study is underpowered to draw definitive conclusions, this pattern aligns with previous reports that mind–body practices and self-care interventions may confer psychological benefits, potentially serving as a buffer against depressive symptoms during intense training {{12990017}}. Notably, while burnout has been identified as a stronger independent predictor of empathy erosion than depression {{5632524}}, the relationship between depression and empathy is still relevant, particularly in female students, underscoring the importance of multifaceted wellness strategies.

Several limitations must be acknowledged. The small sample, attrition rate, and self-selection bias (students opted in to the MBM course) constrain generalizability and may underestimate or exaggerate the impact of MBM. Additionally, reliance on self-report instruments may not capture nuanced changes in empathy or psychological distress, and the brief follow-up period precludes assessment of longer-term or delayed effects. Future studies with larger randomized cohorts, longitudinal follow-up, and objective measures of both student well-being and patient outcomes are needed to conclusively delineate the impact of MBM and similar curricula.

In summary, our results parallel and extend existing literature by reaffirming that stress increases and empathy declines during the first year of medical school—phenomena not mitigated by brief MBM participation. However, the attenuation of depressive symptom progression in MBM participants suggests targeted mind–body interventions may serve as a protective factor against medical student depression. Comprehensive strategies addressing both individual resilience and structural sources of distress may ultimately be necessary to sustain empathy and wellness throughout medical training.
