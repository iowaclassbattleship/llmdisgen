The presented work advances the methodology for analyzing scalar-on-function regression under latent heterogeneity by developing wavelet-based functional mixture regression (WBFMR) models with ℓ₁-penalized estimation of component-specific coefficient functions. This approach addresses scenarios where the association between functional predictors and scalar outcomes varies unobservedly across subpopulations, extending the classical functional linear model to a mixture framework accommodating such heterogeneity.

The wavelet-based representation leverages the multiresolution properties of wavelets, capturing both global and local features of functional predictors and coefficient functions. This is particularly advantageous when predictors possess multi-scale or localized characteristics, including functional signals with sharp transitions or images, offering a natural mechanism for parsimonious representation through sparse wavelet coefficients. Dimension reduction is critical as the predictor functions are observed on dense grids or have very high dimension, enabling computational tractability and improved interpretability.

The use of ℓ₁-penalization within the estimation framework parallels established high-dimensional regression methodologies, notably the Lasso, and promotes sparse solutions enhancing variable selection at the wavelet coefficient level. The adaptive weighted ℓ₁ penalization refines this further, potentially reducing bias and yielding better variable selection properties, although simulation results indicate similar empirical performance between adaptive and standard ℓ₁ penalties in the settings considered.

Methodologically, the proposed model benefits from a reparameterization of the finite mixture regression model that interpolates coefficient shrinkage with variance scaling, improving both interpretability and optimization stability. The EM-type algorithm adapted for the wavelet domain, incorporating coordinate descent and active set strategies, provides an efficient computational procedure with guaranteed convergence to stationary points under the convex penalty case (γ=0). This is essential given the inherent non-convexity of mixture likelihoods and the high dimensionality of the parameter space.

Simulation studies demonstrate the strength of WBFMR compared to a functional principal components-based finite mixture regression approach. The wavelet-based methods exhibit superior estimation and predictive performance, particularly for complex, “bumpy” coefficient functions characterized by local fluctuations. This underscores the capacity of wavelets to localize and adapt to features that are otherwise challenging for global basis expansions such as principal components. Predictive loss and estimation accuracy benefit further at higher signal-to-noise ratios and denser functional sampling, reflecting the model’s ability to exploit finer resolution in data.

Tuning parameter selection, critical in regularization methods, gains practical guidance from cross-validation and modified BIC criteria evaluated on multiple simulations. Cross-validation tends to prefer more complex models (potential modest overfitting), while BIC favors parsimony, but both approaches yield comparable predictive performance and reasonable component number identification, lending robustness to the selection scheme.

The real data application involving diffusion tensor imaging profiles linked to cognitive scores in multiple sclerosis patients exemplifies the model's usefulness. The WBFMR identifies two distinct subgroups differing in the relationship between fractional anisotropy profiles and auditory cognitive test scores. One subgroup exhibits a significant localized association across specific tract regions, while the other shows effectively no association. This heterogeneous pattern captures clinically relevant variation without requiring prior subgroup labels, highlighting the model's practical implications for uncovering latent clinical phenotypes or pathophysiological mechanisms.

Comparisons to single-component wavelet models and functional principal components mixture models reinforce the value of the mixture approach and wavelet basis in both prediction and interpretability. The lower cross-validated prediction error with WBFMR supports its utility for individualized prediction and subgroup identification.

Taken together, the wavelet-based finite mixture regression framework and its penalized estimation algorithm provide a powerful and flexible tool to model complex heterogeneous associations between functional predictors and scalar responses. The approach bridges the gap between classical scalar-on-function regression and mixture modeling in high-dimensional function spaces, with theoretical support for estimation stability and practical effectiveness demonstrated through simulations and real data.

Future research avenues include theoretical advancements addressing the challenges posed by local optima in non-convex mixture estimations and extensions to generalized responses or multiple functional predictors. Moreover, investigating alternative penalties, Bayesian formulations, or integration with functional clustering may further enhance modeling flexibility. Application to high-dimensional imaging and longitudinal functional data may also benefit from the wavelet mixture framework, given its computational efficiency and ability to capture multi-scale heterogeneity.
