**Discussion**

This study provides insights into the reciprocal interactions between neurons and their target muscle cells, specifically focusing on how skeletal muscle influences the cholinergic phenotype of spinal cord (SC) neurons in vitro. Using both direct coculture approaches and treatment with conditioned medium (CM) from muscle cells, we analyzed changes in the activity of choline acetyltransferase (CAT)—the enzyme responsible for acetylcholine synthesis—in SC cell cultures. We examined the specificity of these effects, the dependence on cell type and quantity, the molecular characteristics of the muscle-derived trophic factors, and the temporal requirements for effective stimulation.

**Specificity and Selectivity of Muscle Influence on SC Neurons**

Our results demonstrate a robust and specific increase in CAT activity when SC cells were cocultured with skeletal muscle, consistent with prior observations of synaptic specialization and neurotransmitter phenotype regulation at neuromuscular junctions {{45013459}}. This induction was selective for the cholinergic marker CAT; other enzymes, including glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), key for GABAergic transmission, remained unchanged or were even decreased under coculture conditions. The lack of parallel enhancement in other enzymatic activities supports the notion that the cholinergic phenotype of spinal cord neurons is specifically promoted by factors associated with skeletal muscle and is not a consequence of generalized cell survival or growth—a conclusion further reinforced by similar neuronal survival in both alone and co-cultured conditions {{22465705}}.

Interestingly, the decrease in GAD activity observed under some coculture conditions suggests that muscle-derived influences may not only induce cholinergic differentiation but could exert repressive effects on alternative neurotransmitter phenotypes, at least in certain developmental windows. The developmental stage of the SC tissue appears important, as GAD reductions were limited to cultures established from younger embryos. This points to a window of susceptibility during which muscle-derived factors can shape neurotransmitter phenotype.

**Trophic Signaling Is Dose-Dependent and Reproducible**

Both SC cell and muscle cell numbers influenced the magnitude of CAT induction in a dose-dependent and, within limits, saturable fashion. More muscle cells yielded progressively greater CAT activity, while excess SC cell numbers could saturate or exceed the stimulatory capacity of the muscle culture. These findings are consonant with the idea of a limiting and titratable supply of trophic factor(s) in the muscle culture, further supporting the existence of specific instructive or permissive factors for the expression of the cholinergic phenotype.

**Muscle-Secreted Soluble Factors Mediate CAT Induction**

A key advance from this work is the demonstration that soluble, secreted factors from muscle cultures (as present in CM) can significantly induce CAT activity in SC cell cultures, recapitulating much of the effect of direct coculture. The effect of muscle CM was dose-dependent and not abolished by heat or dialysis, suggesting that the active ingredient(s) are relatively large, stable macromolecules (molecular weight >50 kDa) rather than small diffusible metabolites. In contrast, muscle CM that had been filtered to remove high molecular weight fractions lost activity, while concentrated retentate was potent in CAT induction. Importantly, muscle CM was effective even when prepared in serum-free conditions, excluding a simple role for serum detoxification or serum protein modification by muscle. These findings are reminiscent of nerve growth factor (NGF) and other polypeptide trophic factors characterized in other neuronal systems.

The effect of CM from myoblast/fibroblast cultures, which were depleted of mature myotubes, produced only a modest suggestion of CAT increase, implying that specific stages of muscle cell differentiation or specific muscle cell types are the principal source of the active factor(s). Furthermore, CM from SC cells themselves could produce smaller, but detectable, increases in CAT, hinting at the possibility that neurons and/or glia within the SC cultures may also secrete lower levels of similar or cooperating trophic factors.

**Temporal Windows and Mechanistic Implications**

The timing of muscle or CM exposure to SC cultures was crucial: only early application (during or shortly after plating) conferred the capacity for robust CAT upregulation. Delayed treatment was markedly less effective, and established SC cultures (>1-2 weeks old) failed to increase CAT activity in response to muscle or CM. This indicates a developmental window of trophic responsiveness, reminiscent of in vivo critical periods for synaptic specification and matches prior findings on the timing of synaptogenesis and transmitter phenotype stabilization.

The additivity (rather than synergy or antagonism) of coculture and CM treatments suggests incomplete saturation of the target mechanism by either treatment alone, though the possibility of distinct but converging pathways cannot be ruled out. The mechanism is also likely independent of ongoing functional neuromuscular transmission, as α-bungarotoxin, which blocks post-synaptic AChRs, did not block the CAT-inducing effect, arguing that direct electrical or synaptic activity is not strictly required for this early trophic signaling.

**Relation to In Vivo and Other In Vitro Systems**

Our findings conform with the view that peripheral targets can retrogradely instruct neurotransmitter phenotype specification, and they extend previous work on muscle-derived trophic regulation of motor neuron traits {{45013459}}. The rapidity, specificity, and cell-number dependence of the effect, together with its replication via soluble factors, are analogous to the actions of NGF on sympathetic neurons or other target-derived influences established in various systems {{43891205}}.

Furthermore, the methodological observations parallel classic work on feeder layer–conditioned media in mammalian cell culture {{85966459}}. Both our work and that of Puck et al. indicate that complex cell-type interactions and indirect cell signaling via secreted factors can have pronounced and specific effects on cell phenotype, beyond the mere promotion of viability or proliferation. In the sympathetic system, target interactions have similarly been shown to be bidirectional and regulatory {{30230624}}, and our model system provides a robust in vitro paradigm for further molecular dissection.

**Conclusions and Future Directions**

This study demonstrates that skeletal muscle cells release a heat- and dialysis-stable macromolecular factor (>50 kDa) that powerfully and selectively upregulates CAT activity in developing spinal cord neuron cultures, with a temporal window during which neurons can respond. The findings provide an in vitro demonstration of muscle-derived trophic instruction of the cholinergic phenotype, consistent with in vivo evidence for synaptic and phenotypic matching between motor neurons and muscle. Future work should focus on the biochemical characterization of the muscle-derived factor(s), determine their identity relative to known neurotrophic factors such as NGF, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), or agrin, and further explore the molecular signaling pathways enabling target-specific neurotransmitter phenotype regulation. These findings underscore the importance of target-derived control in neuronal development and provide an experimental system for dissecting the secreted molecules responsible for synaptic specification.
