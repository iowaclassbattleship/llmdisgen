Based on the abstract provided, the research focuses on the development and implantation of implantable biofuel cells (GBFCs) powered by glucose and oxygen from the body fluids of living organisms. The concept involves using enzymes and redox mediators that are compatible with extra-cellular fluid (ECF) conditions, enabling efficient generation of electrical power inside a living organism, particularly a rat. The innovation lies in mechanically confining the enzymes and redox mediators within the electrodes, allowing for a simple and cost-effective assembly process.

Key findings from the study include: 
1. Successful implantation and functioning of a GBFC inside a living rat, generating sufficient power for electronic devices.
2. In vitro and in vivo demonstrations of stable and continuous power generation by the GBFC.
3. Investigation on the inhibition of laccase by chloride ions under physiological conditions.
4. Evaluation of the activity of laccase in free form at pH 7.
5. Determination of the activity of the entrapped and electrically wired enzymes in the biofuel cell.

The research demonstrates the feasibility and potential of GBFCs as efficient power sources for implantable devices, showcasing stable and continuous power generation capabilities. The use of enzymes and redox mediators compatible with ECF conditions, along with the mechanical confinement method, presents a promising approach for future advancements in implantable biofuel cell technology. Further studies are needed to explore long-term performance, biocompatibility, and the scalability of these biofuel cells for various medical applications.
