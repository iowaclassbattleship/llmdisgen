Discussion

This work presents a significant advancement in the theory of interactive proofs involving polynomial-time classical verifiers and quantum provers restricted to single operations, demonstrating that all languages in BQP admit such interactive proofs with polynomially many provers. The construction relies critically on two components: self-testing of graph states and measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). The self-testing guarantees that untrusted quantum provers share a suitable graph state and perform measurements closely approximating ideal X-Z plane observables, while MBQC provides a universal computational model via adaptive single-qubit measurements on such graph states.

The improved error analysis for the self-testing of triangular cluster states is a key technical contribution enabling robust verification with polynomial resources. Specifically, the established polynomial scaling in the number of trials for constant error is a substantial improvement over prior exponential bounds, making the self-test practical for larger graphs. Furthermore, the extension of the test to cover the entire X-Z plane enables the implementation of arbitrary single-qubit rotations required for universality, overcoming limitations of earlier real-valued or Pauli-only measurements. The careful treatment of adaptive measurements and propagation of errors through them establishes that measurement patterns on untrusted devices produce outputs close to the ideal MBQC outcomes, a nontrivial extension given the intricacies of conditional measurement bases.

Compared to Reichardt et al.’s prior landmark result using two polynomial-time provers, each with polynomially many gate operations, this work adopts a complementary model with polynomially many provers each performing just a single measurement. This simplicity has conceptual and practical benefits. Operationally, the provers need only perform fixed single-qubit measurements, eliminating the need for full process tomography or interleaved teleportations. Conceptually, the MBQC procedure executed on the verified graph state literally mirrors the trusted-device computation, strengthening the interpretability of the protocol. However, the increase to polynomially many provers is a natural trade-off for this simplification.

The construction of the one-shot test for honesty is elegant, combining subtests for stabilizer generators of the graph state and for measurement angles, with acceptance probability bounds tightly linked to the closeness (in the ǫ-equivalence sense) of the provers’ state and measurements to the ideal. This test guarantees that any deviation by the provers reduces their probability of passing measurably, providing soundness necessary for interactive proofs. The explicit consideration of complexity-theoretic parameters ensures that a constant gap between acceptance probabilities can be established with polynomial overhead, thereby enabling efficient classical verification.

The integration of self-testing and MBQC also offers significant practical implications for near-term quantum computing. Classical verification of quantum computations is a fundamental open problem in quantum computational complexity and a central challenge for delegated quantum computing. This protocol provides a pathway toward verifying quantum computations with restricted classical hardware, using an array of simple quantum devices as provers. The explicit construction may inspire future experimental implementations of quantum verification against malicious untrusted devices using multipartite entangled states and minimal prover side operations.

In terms of limitations and future directions, the current protocol’s error bounds, while polynomial, are still loose and could be further tightened for improved efficiency and robustness. Also, reducing the number of provers back toward a constant (e.g., two) while retaining the benefits of this single-measurement-per-prover model remains an open challenge. The note about bipartite graph states for two-prover self-testing suggests interesting avenues for adapting this framework to fewer provers with suitable graph structures. Extending these techniques to continuous variable systems or other quantum computational models could broaden their applicability.

Moreover, the use of triangular cluster states, while advantageous for error analysis, might limit architectural choices for quantum hardware. Investigating other graph families permitting efficient self-testing and universal MBQC might increase practical flexibility.

In summary, this work provides a rigorous and efficient framework for classical verification of BQP via interactive proofs with multiple simple quantum provers, expanding the toolbox of quantum complexity theory and quantum cryptographic verification. The novel self-testing results for graph states, error-robust adaptive MBQC analysis, and synthesis into an interactive protocol represent a meaningful advance with potential impacts both theoretical and practical.
