The study discussed the implementation of everolimus with reduced tacrolimus in de novo liver transplant recipients to assess its efficacy and safety in maintaining renal function while minimizing calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-related nephrotoxicity. The primary endpoint was the composite efficacy failure rate of treated biopsy-proven acute rejection (tBPAR), graft loss, or death at 12 months post-transplantation. The study was a 24-month prospective, randomized, multicenter trial involving adult recipients of primary full-size liver transplants. Patients were randomized into three arms: TAC Elimination, EVR+Reduced TAC, and TAC Control. The TAC Elimination arm was terminated early due to a higher rate of tBPAR, which clustered after tacrolimus withdrawal. The EVR+Reduced TAC group showed superior renal function compared to the TAC Control group, with a clinically relevant difference in the change of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from randomization to month 12. The EVR+Reduced TAC regimen was statistically noninferior to the TAC Control arm for the primary efficacy endpoint. No severe rejection episodes were reported in the EVR+Reduced TAC group, demonstrating the regimen's efficacy without compromising safety. Adverse events were generally similar between the EVR+Reduced TAC and TAC Control groups, with a slightly higher risk of peripheral edema and leukopenia in the EVR+Reduced TAC group. Despite a trend towards more serious infections in the EVR+Reduced TAC group, the regimen was well tolerated with similar tolerability to the standard tacrolimus regimen. In conclusion, the early introduction of everolimus with reduced tacrolimus demonstrated superior renal function and safety outcomes without compromising efficacy in liver transplant recipients at 1 year post-transplant, offering a promising alternative regimen in liver transplantation.
