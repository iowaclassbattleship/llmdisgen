Discussion

This study provides important insights into the biological roles of soluble syndecan-1 ectodomains in modulating protease activity during tissue injury and repair. Our results demonstrate that the syndecan-1 ectodomain, through its heparan sulfate (HS) chains, binds with high affinity to neutrophil-derived serine proteases cathepsin G and elastase. This interaction markedly reduces the rate and extent of protease inhibition by their physiological serpins, including α1-antichymotrypsin (α1-Achy), squamous cell carcinoma antigen 2 (SCCA2), and α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1-PI). Notably, syndecan-1 ectodomains mimic the effect of heparin in this context by binding directly to the proteases and protecting them from rapid serpin-mediated inhibition, thereby sustaining proteolytic activity.

The binding affinity (K_d ~35–56 nM) and functional effects of syndecan-1 ectodomains on these proteases are comparable to, or in some cases exceed, those observed with pharmaceutical heparin, indicating that cell-surface derived HS proteoglycans can serve as endogenous regulators of protease-antiprotease interactions at sites of inflammation. Enzymatic removal of HS chains from syndecan-1 ectodomains significantly diminished their capacity to protect proteases from inhibition, underscoring the critical role of HS in mediating these effects. Chondroitin sulfate chains, in contrast, were dispensable for this function.

By examining acute human dermal wound fluids, which contain active neutrophil proteases, their respective serpins, and shed syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 ectodomains, we provide ex vivo evidence that endogenous syndecan ectodomains contribute to the proteolytic balance within inflammatory wound environments. Treatment of acute wound fluids with heparanase and heparitinase to degrade endogenous HS chains decreased elastolytic activity, an effect reversible by exogenous heparin addition. Furthermore, immunodepletion of syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains from wound fluids significantly reduced elastolytic protease activity, implicating these proteoglycans as key modulators of proteolytic homeostasis.

These findings are consistent with a model wherein shed syndecan ectodomains act as heparin-like molecules that fine-tune protease-antiprotease dynamics during the inflammatory phase of tissue repair. By partially inhibiting protease activity directly while simultaneously protecting proteases from serpin inactivation, syndecan-1 ectodomains help maintain a controlled proteolytic environment conducive to extracellular matrix remodeling, growth factor activation, and cell migration necessary for proper wound healing.

The physiological implications of these results are broad. Dysregulated protease activity is a hallmark of numerous chronic inflammatory and degenerative diseases, including chronic wounds, emphysema, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis. Alterations in syndecan expression or ectodomain shedding could therefore contribute to pathological proteolytic imbalances, impairing tissue repair and promoting disease progression. Further studies exploring syndecan dynamics in such contexts are warranted.

In addition, these data raise the possibility that other shed heparan sulfate proteoglycans, such as syndecan-4, glypicans, or CD44, may similarly participate in regulating proteolytic balance through their HS chains. This expands the paradigm of HS proteoglycans not only as cell surface co-receptors but also as soluble modulators of extracellular protease activity in inflammatory milieus.

In summary, our work identifies a novel physiological role for soluble syndecan-1 ectodomains in maintaining proteolytic balance in acute wound fluids via HS-mediated interactions with neutrophil serine proteases. This mechanism likely supports effective tissue repair by regulating protease activity through a balance of direct inhibition and protection from rapid serpin-mediated inactivation. Understanding this regulatory axis offers potential therapeutic avenues to modulate protease activity in wounds and inflammatory diseases characterized by protease-antiprotease imbalance.
