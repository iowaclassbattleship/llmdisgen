The present study successfully establishes and extensively characterizes an orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of high-risk neuroblastoma, addressing critical limitations of traditional neuroblastoma preclinical models that rely on cell lines. Unlike conventional cell line-derived xenografts, which often undergo in vitro selection leading to genomic and phenotypic divergence from the original tumor, the PDX model retains key molecular, histopathologic, and metastatic features of the primary patient tumor, including MYCN amplification, chromosomal aberrations, and tumor marker expression. This fidelity is demonstrated by the strong correlation in gene expression profiles between the patient tumor and xenograft, the conservation of critical chromosomal rearrangements and gains/deletions, as well as DNA methylation patterns. Notably, the PDX tumors displayed substantial invasive growth and spontaneous metastasis to clinically relevant sites including liver, lungs, and importantly, bone marrow, mirroring the metastatic pattern observed in patients. In contrast, orthotopic SK-N-BE(2)c cell line xenografts showed limited metastatic capacity, particularly lacking bone marrow involvement, underscoring the enhanced clinical relevance of PDX models.

The ability to establish PDXs from both fresh and viably cryopreserved tumor explants significantly expands the utility of this approach by overcoming tissue accessibility constraints inherent in rare pediatric tumors. Cryopreservation did not compromise engraftment efficiency, enabling the creation of biobanked materials suitable for widespread distribution and standardized preclinical testing.

The development and integration of imaging modalities such as FDG-PET and MRI allowed for noninvasive monitoring of tumor growth and spread within orthotopic sites, compensating for the lack of superficial tumor accessibility and enabling longitudinal assessment of therapeutic efficacy in vivo. This imaging capability is crucial for preclinical drug evaluation given the orthotopic anatomical context.

Moreover, the study demonstrated the feasibility of serial propagation of PDX tumors in immunodeficient mice, with passage-associated acceleration of tumor growth observed, a phenomenon often seen in PDX models reflecting tumor adaptation to the murine microenvironment. The derivation of tumor cells from PDXs that grow as neurospheres in serum-free conditions with maintained neuroblastoma marker expression and robust tumorigenic and metastatic potential upon re-implantation further provides a platform for in vitro mechanistic studies and compound screening in a biologically relevant context.

The comparative therapeutic evaluation utilizing a robust, randomized, double-blind preclinical trial design highlighted that both standard-of-care chemotherapy and molecularly targeted agents directed against the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway exerted significant effects on tumor growth and survival in the PDX model. Notably, treatment regimens combining IGF1R inhibition (OSI-906) with PI3K/mTOR inhibitors (BEZ235 or BKM120) prolonged survival relative to placebo and exhibited distinct histopathologic effects such as decreased angiogenesis and macrophage infiltration within tumors, consistent with prior reports of anti-angiogenic activity of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway blockade. Although the combination of OSI-906 and BKM120 showed the most pronounced survival benefit, pairwise comparisons among treatment groups did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to variability inherent in the model or limited sample size.

Histological analyses provided mechanistic insights with increased markers of proliferation and apoptosis corresponding to specific treatments, suggesting that BKM120 may induce G2/M cell cycle arrest alongside apoptosis, while BEZ235 primarily reduced viable tumor fraction and vascularization. The observed reduction in tumor-associated macrophage infiltration with targeted therapies may be relevant given the known role of tumor-associated macrophages in neuroblastoma progression and therapy resistance.

Importantly, the establishment of culture conditions conducive to high-throughput drug screening using dissociated PDX tumor cells in a 3D matrix format represents a valuable tool for rapid assessment of drug sensitivity, highlighting differences in chemosensitivity compared with established neuroblastoma cell lines. This approach may facilitate identification of novel agents or drug combinations effective against clinically recalcitrant neuroblastoma.

Collectively, this study provides a comprehensive platform for neuroblastoma translational research, integrating clinically relevant disease modeling with genomic fidelity, metastasis recapitulation, and systematic therapeutic evaluation. The PDX model addresses the translational gap inherent to cell line models, offering opportunities to test targeted therapies in a context that closely mimics human neuroblastoma biology. Future expansion of the PDX repository to encompass the heterogeneity of neuroblastoma, including non-MYCN amplified subtypes, and incorporation of these models into co-clinical trials could further enhance personalized therapeutic strategies. Additionally, combining these orthotopic PDX models with emerging imaging and molecular endpoints will enable refined mechanistic studies and expedite the preclinical assessment pipeline for novel neuroblastoma therapeutics.
