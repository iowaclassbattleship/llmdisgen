The findings from this large, randomized, controlled trial demonstrate that early introduction of everolimus combined with reduced tacrolimus exposure (EVR+Reduced TAC) provides a clinically meaningful improvement in renal function without compromising immunosuppressive efficacy in de novo liver transplant recipients. This is particularly significant given the well-documented nephrotoxic effects associated with calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) such as tacrolimus, which remain the cornerstone of immunosuppression but contribute to chronic kidney disease in a substantial proportion of liver transplant patients over time (4,5). The preservation of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) observed as early as one month following initiation of everolimus and maintained through 12 months suggests that CNI dose reduction mediated by mTOR inhibitor co-administration can effectively mitigate progressive renal decline that typically occurs under standard tacrolimus regimens.

Importantly, the EVR+Reduced TAC regimen maintained noninferiority with respect to the composite efficacy endpoint including treated biopsy-proven acute rejection (tBPAR), graft loss, or death at one year post-transplant, and in fact demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of tBPAR compared to tacrolimus monotherapy. The absence of moderate or severe rejection episodes in the EVR group further supports the robustness of this immunosuppressive strategy. However, it should be noted that tacrolimus trough concentrations in the EVR+Reduced TAC cohort tended to remain slightly above the predefined target range (3–5 ng/mL), indicating potential room for further CNI minimization and enhanced renal protection, pending careful monitoring of rejection risk.

The premature termination of the tacrolimus elimination arm due to a higher rejection rate underscores that complete withdrawal of CNIs as early as 30 days post-transplant in an unselected population is not currently feasible without induction therapy or adjunct immunosuppressants. This highlights the importance of maintaining at least low-level CNI exposure when using mTOR inhibitors de novo. These results align with prior studies indicating that mTOR inhibition without concomitant CNIs or induction leads to increased rejection risk (25). Future investigations incorporating induction agents may refine protocols to allow safe CNI withdrawal in select patient subsets.

Safety analyses revealed a tolerability profile consistent with known pharmacological effects of mTOR inhibitors. While the EVR+Reduced TAC group experienced higher rates of peripheral edema and leukopenia, the overall incidence of serious adverse events, including wound-healing complications and infections, was comparable to controls. Proteinuria was observed but remained below clinically concerning thresholds, and renal dysfunction severe enough to require renal replacement therapy was rare across groups. The safety data corroborate previous reports that early administration of everolimus at day 30 post-transplant balances efficacy with acceptable adverse effect rates and low vascular or wound-related complications (30–33).

Several study design considerations warrant emphasis. The open-label nature and protocol-mandated tacrolimus trough targets established prior to more recent trends toward aggressive CNI minimization may limit direct generalizability; contemporary regimens employing lower tacrolimus levels could potentially enhance renal outcomes further in everolimus-based protocols. Additionally, although the mean baseline eGFR was near normal, subgroup analyses suggest that patients with moderately impaired renal function at baseline similarly benefit from EVR+Reduced TAC. The lack of mycophenolate mofetil in the control arm, now common in clinical practice, may have influenced comparative efficacy results. Furthermore, use of eGFR rather than measured GFR poses inherent accuracy limitations, although multiple estimation formulas consistently confirmed the renal benefit.

In summary, early initiation of everolimus beginning at day 30 after liver transplantation, in combination with reduced-dose tacrolimus, results in superior renal function preservation without loss of efficacy or increased graft loss at 12 months. This regimen represents a valuable alternative to conventional tacrolimus monotherapy and may improve long-term post-transplant outcomes by mitigating CNI-associated nephrotoxicity. Ongoing studies with longer follow-up will inform whether these benefits translate into sustained renal protection and reduced chronic kidney disease progression, as well as potential advantages regarding malignancy and viral recurrence. Further evaluations optimizing dosing strategies and exploring induction-enabled CNI elimination remain important to enhance the therapeutic index of immunosuppression in liver transplantation.
