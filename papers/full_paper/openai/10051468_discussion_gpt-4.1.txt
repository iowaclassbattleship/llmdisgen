**Discussion**

The present study provides insight into the source and regulation of fibronectin deposition in the microvasculature during wound healing. By employing species-specific anti-fibronectin antibodies and a rat-to-mouse skin xenograft model, we were able to discriminate between fibronectin synthesized locally (by donor rat vessels) and plasma-derived fibronectin provided by the recipient (mouse). Our data demonstrate that, during the early phases of wound healing, activated and proliferating endothelial cells in donor (rat) vessels exhibited a pronounced increase in fibronectin staining when detected with anti-rat—but not anti-mouse—fibronectin antibodies. This suggests that fibronectin in the vessel wall near the wound was predominantly synthesized in situ by donor endothelial cells, rather than being derived from the mouse plasma.

The specificity of these findings is reinforced by several controls: (1) anti-mouse fibronectin antibodies clearly labeled mouse vasculature in control tissues, (2) antibody specificity was confirmed by antigen absorption, and (3) we did not observe dual labeling with both antibodies at the graft-host vascular interface. These controls argue strongly against the possibility of antibody cross-reactivity or nonspecific deposition, supporting our interpretation of local synthesis.

Our findings are consistent with the concept that endothelial cells can upregulate fibronectin production in response to injury and proliferative cues. Autoradiographic evidence of increased [^3H]thymidine incorporation near the wound edge further links fibronectin synthesis to endothelial cell activation and proliferation. Previous studies had distinguished between plasma-derived and cell-derived fibronectin—two forms that, while similar, have distinct characteristics and tissue distributions {{VUENTO1977}},{{YAMADA1979}}. Our data support earlier claims that the endothelium possesses the capacity for local fibronectin synthesis and that this process is dynamically regulated during tissue repair {{17786725}},{{14452609}}.

In contrast, in vitro studies have shown that cultured cells can incorporate exogenous fibronectin from plasma (or serum) into their pericellular matrix, regardless of minor biochemical differences between plasma and cellular forms of fibronectin {{13161383}}. However, in our in vivo model, plasma-derived (mouse) fibronectin was not detected in the donor (rat) vessel wall despite its presence in the circulation, indicating that, under injury-induced proliferative conditions, newly synthesized cellular fibronectin may predominate or that the assembly of vessel wall fibronectin is controlled by local synthesis rather than nonspecific deposition from plasma.

These findings also have technical implications. In vitro, the presence of fibronectin on cell surfaces can result partly from absorption of serum-derived fibronectin, complicating interpretations regarding cellular fibronectin biosynthesis in culture {{13161383}}. Our reciprocal antibody approach, used in vivo, circumvents this problem and provides more definitive evidence for local synthesis. Importantly, our results caution that the detection of fibronectin using non-species-specific antibodies in tissue sections or cell culture cannot unequivocally determine the source of fibronectin.

Finally, the observed co-localization of locally synthesized fibronectin with sites of endothelial activation supports the hypothesis that fibronectin plays a role in angiogenesis and tissue repair. This is consistent with other studies showing upregulation of extracellular matrix proteins as part of the wound healing response {{VAHERI1978}}. Future investigations should address the regulatory mechanisms controlling endothelial fibronectin gene expression and the functional consequences of local versus plasma-derived fibronectin during angiogenesis and wound healing.

In summary, our study provides direct evidence for in situ synthesis of fibronectin by endothelial cells during wound repair, underscores the importance of local extracellular matrix production in vascular remodeling, and highlights the utility of species-specific antibody techniques in tracing protein origins in vivo.
