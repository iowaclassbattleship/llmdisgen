The discussion on the proposed gait recognition approach using the Angle Embedded Gait Dynamic Image (AE-GDI) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) emphasizes several critical contributions and implications of the findings presented in this study. 

Firstly, the introduction of AE-GDI as a new representation method marks a significant advancement over the traditional Gait Dynamic Image (GDI) approach, particularly in terms of orientation and translation invariance. This robustness against variations in sensor orientation is particularly crucial in real-world applications, where wearable devices may not always be positioned consistently. By transforming the problem of time series classification into an image recognition task, AE-GDIs allow for the effective application of established image classification techniques. This pivot not only enhances recognition performance but also increases the applicability of existing convolutional architectures to gait recognition tasks.

The integration of a grid-based greedy algorithm for gait cycle segmentation further strengthens the methodology. This approach improves the accuracy of starting position detection, addressing previously encountered challenges in gait cycle segmentation that often arise from noise and variability in the data. This is critical for ensuring that the AE-GDIs generated are representative of authentic gait patterns, allowing the CNN to learn more effectively from the input data. 

From an empirical standpoint, results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms several baseline models when applied to both gait authentication and labeling tasks. The improvement noted in accuracy, in comparison to other state-of-the-art techniques, highlights the efficacy of the CNN architecture designed for this task. Moreover, the ability of the CNN to learn discriminative features autonomously negates the need for extensive manual feature extraction, thus increasing efficiency and potentially reducing the risk of human error in feature selection.

In the context of gait authentication, the analysis reveals that the performance metrics—precision, recall, and accuracy—are improved at similar conditions as other proposed methods. Notably, the fact that the system maintains its effectiveness across different days, despite changes in subjects' clothing and footwear, indicates remarkable generalization ability. However, this performance does come with a caution regarding the sensitivity of the AE-GDI to sensor placement variations. This warrants future investigations into methods for increasing robustness against sensor misalignment, which is common in practical applications.

The contribution of AE-GDI aligns with broader trends in biometric recognition technologies that focus on non-intrusive, continuous monitoring, particularly relevant in an era where mobile and wearable technologies play an increasing role in personal security and health monitoring. In this regard, the findings of this study can serve as a basis for exploring additional biometric modalities and enhancing existing systems with more complex features relevant to gait recognition.

Looking forward, the paper posits that further research should explore integrating more sophisticated models, such as convolutional recurrent neural networks, which may provide even greater robustness to temporal correlations inherent in gait data. The extension to other types of sensor data or multimodal biometric systems could also be pursued to encompass a wider array of personal identification applications. 

In summary, the proposed gait recognition method using AE-GDI and CNN demonstrates significant advancements in accuracy and efficiency, paving the way for more reliable biometric solutions and future innovations in gait analysis and wearable technology applications.
