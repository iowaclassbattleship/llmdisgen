Discussion

The background study highlights the widespread use of presumptive malaria treatment without prior diagnostic confirmation in Sierra Leone, especially in both urban and rural contexts, contributing to potential overuse or misuse of antimalarial drugs and delayed treatment of non-malarial febrile illnesses. Given this challenge, the World Health Organization and global health partners advocate for test-based malaria treatment, primarily relying on microscopy and malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). RDTs are particularly valuable in decentralized settings due to their ease of use, rapid results, and capacity for deployment by community health workers (CHWs) or volunteers (CHVs).

The study findings reveal significant socio-economic disparities between rural and urban residents in Bo, Sierra Leone, with rural inhabitants facing lower educational attainment, literacy, and poorer perceived health—all factors that may influence health-seeking behavior and malaria testing uptake. Notably, a substantial majority of rural residents demonstrate strong preferences for home-based malaria testing, particularly when assisted by a CHV, rather than laboratory-based testing. This preference is also evident but less pronounced in urban areas, where a plurality favors laboratory testing. The high confidence reported by rural respondents in conducting self/family-based home testing upon training suggests potential for effective task-shifting and community empowerment in malaria diagnosis.

Importantly, although a considerable proportion of participants—especially in urban areas—consult healthcare providers when malaria is suspected, there remains a high prevalence of treatment procurement without prior testing, mostly through self-medication or unregulated pharmaceutical purchase. Reasons cited for not seeking testing include cost, delay to see if fever resolves, travel difficulties, and presumptive diagnosis based on experience, with a notable minority expressing beliefs that adults always have malaria when febrile, which could hinder test uptake.

The study’s results align with prior literature emphasizing cultural, financial, and geographical barriers to formal malaria testing, and they underscore the critical role that community case management (CCM) programs employing CHWs can play in expanding access to confirmatory testing and appropriate treatment in settings with limited healthcare infrastructure. The preference for CHV-assisted testing over self-testing among respondents, coupled with their willingness to pay for home-based testing, suggests that investing in CHW networks to deliver RDTs may increase testing rates and reduce presumptive treatment.

The findings further suggest that CCM programs must ensure adequate training, motivation, and supervision of CHWs and CHVs to maintain high diagnostic performance and trust in their services. Lessons from other contexts, such as Sierra Leone’s MSF-supported malaria programs and Senegal’s CCMm experience, highlight challenges with referral completion, stock management, and sustaining CHW participation, emphasizing that the success of CCM depends on addressing logistical constraints and community trust.

Moreover, the recent Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone underscores the value of home-based testing modalities that minimize exposure risks and maintain continuity of care when formal health services are disrupted. Home-based malaria testing and treatment administered or supervised by trusted CHWs can mitigate risks related to clinic closures and quarantine measures, reducing transmission risks and improving timely malaria care.

Integration of rapid diagnostic testing in community settings holds promise not only to rationalize antimalarial drug use and reduce inappropriate treatments but also to enable early identification of febrile illnesses warranting referral, thus improving overall febrile illness management. However, this requires addressing recurring challenges such as ensuring continuous supply of test kits and drugs, providing community education to counter misconceptions about malaria and testing, and establishing effective referral systems to handle cases beyond CHW capacity.

In summary, the study supports intensification and expansion of community case management for malaria in Sierra Leone, leveraging the preference and acceptability of home-based RDT testing facilitated by CHWs. To realize improved malaria control outcomes, programs must invest in CHW training, community engagement, reliable supply chains, and supportive supervision structures. Inclusion of community perceptions, economic considerations, and local sociocultural contexts will be essential to optimize uptake of diagnostic testing and adherence to treatment protocols, ultimately reducing malaria morbidity and mortality in endemic settings.
