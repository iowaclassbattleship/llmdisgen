Discussion

This cross-sectional, population-based study provides important insights into the malaria testing practices, attitudes, and preferences for testing location among rural and urban residents of Bo District, Sierra Leone. Our findings show that a majority of rural residents, and a significant minority of urban residents, prefer home-based malaria testing over laboratory-based testing, with a particularly strong preference for testing conducted by community health volunteers (CHVs) rather than self/family testing. These findings must be understood in the context of high rates of presumptive self-diagnosis and treatment of febrile illness, limited access to formal healthcare systems, and cultural and socioeconomic barriers to facility-based testing.

The observed preference for home-based testing in rural areas aligns with reported barriers to accessing health facilities, such as travel time, cost, and limited availability of formal health services—a recurrent theme in similar studies across sub-Saharan Africa {{20889255}}, {{35364155}}, {{10253380}}, {{1841654}}. These structural barriers, combined with lower socioeconomic status and self-reported lower health outcomes among rural respondents, likely contribute to greater willingness to adopt convenient, community-based testing methods. Conversely, urban residents, who generally have better access to healthcare facilities and higher literacy rates, were more likely to prefer laboratory-based testing, especially among those with higher educational attainment.

A key finding is the high level of confidence among rural respondents in CHV-assisted malaria testing compared to self/family-conducted testing. This may reflect trust in trained CHVs and recognition of their role as accessible and reliable healthcare providers in settings where formal laboratory infrastructure is limited or absent. Prior literature indicates that community-based models leveraging CHWs or CHVs, with proper training and supervision, can maintain high sensitivity and specificity in RDT usage, and high adherence to test results, as seen in other African countries including Zambia, Sudan, and Uganda {{6084901}}, {{7359381}}, {{18750996}}, {{74007}}, {{10158}}, {{839}}. Notably, many respondents with a preference for home-based self-testing indicated a willingness to use such tests if provided with adequate training, suggesting that capacity-building and skills transfer are critical for expanding self-testing.

Despite the advantages of home-based and community testing, significant challenges remain. The study observed that only a minority of participants consistently seek parasitological confirmation of malaria before treatment, with most relying on presumptive diagnosis followed by self-medication or purchase of drugs from local vendors. This is concerning given the risks of overtreatment, inappropriate use of antimalarials, and diagnostic delays for non-malarial febrile illnesses. While RDTs have improved accuracy and access to malaria testing outside laboratory settings, their impact is limited if patients do not perceive value in testing or if testing is not tightly coupled to appropriate clinical decision-making {{74007}}, {{7359381}}, {{30384887}}.

Importantly, we found that cost, time, and the inconvenience or unacceptability of travel to clinical facilities are dominant barriers to utilizing facility-based testing, particularly for rural respondents. Consistent with previous research, dislike of blood draws was relatively rare as a barrier, while presumptive confidence in clinical self-diagnosis remains common, especially in communities with strong beliefs about fever causation and low awareness of differential diagnosis {{1219402}}, {{20889255}}, {{30384887}}. These findings underscore the ongoing need for public health interventions to improve recognition of non-malaria febrile illnesses and the importance of confirmed diagnosis, as emphasized by WHO test-treat-track guidelines {{14536605}}.

Our results highlight several implications for malaria control policy and program design. First, CHV- and CHW-based community case management (CCM), enabled by point-of-care RDTs, appears feasible, acceptable, and responsive to expressed community preferences, especially in rural populations. This echoes systematic reviews showing that well-trained CHWs using RDTs achieve high diagnostic accuracy, high adherence to test results, and good community acceptability, with additional evidence that CCM can reduce the burden on peripheral health facilities and increase rates of timely, effective treatment {{30808505}}, {{74007}}, {{7359381}}, {{6084901}}, {{1841654}}, {{18750996}}, {{10158}}, {{839}}, {{30384887}}, {{13229}}. However, successful program implementation will require a robust support infrastructure—including reliable commodity supply chains, ongoing training and supervision for CHVs/CHWs, and active community engagement to foster trust and compliance. Prior studies highlight risks of stock-outs, which can undermine the credibility and sustainability of community-based programs {{1841654}}, {{30808505}}.

Second, while enthusiasm for self-testing after proper instruction exists, there remains a pronounced gap in confidence for truly independent home testing. Thus, scaling up home-based self-testing without direct support may be premature and should be coupled with careful piloting, monitoring, and skills transfer.

Third, the high level of willingness to pay for home-based testing among those who prefer such services suggests that a modest user fee model could be considered for test kit distribution, provided it does not create or exacerbate inequities in the poorest groups—an issue identified in the literature as a potential problem for both CCM and facility-based programs {{1219402}}, {{30384887}}.

Fourth, the study indicates a persistent gap between policy (test-before-treat) and practice, with self-diagnosis and presumptive treatment remaining the norm for most febrile illnesses. Community education, demand generation, and tailored messaging around the importance of confirmed diagnosis must therefore remain central components of malaria control strategies.

Limitations of this study include its cross-sectional design, which cannot establish causality, and the fact that self-reported practices and attitudes may not always predict actual behavior. Social desirability bias may have affected some responses, particularly on questions regarding willingness to use or pay for tests. In addition, while the survey achieved high participation rates, the exclusion of households that declined participation may have introduced some bias. Finally, the study was conducted prior to the Ebola epidemic, which significantly reduced access to health facilities and altered the healthcare landscape in Sierra Leone. As such, the field context may have shifted since the survey, although the findings on home-based and CCM approaches are likely to have gained increased relevance in post-outbreak contexts.

In summary, our findings support efforts to expand properly trained and supervised community case management for malaria using RDTs, particularly in rural communities with limited access to formal laboratory services. Programs should leverage the trust and preference for CHVs/CHWs, strengthen training and support for community malaria testing, and address operational barriers to ensure consistent availability of test kits and medicines. Future policy should balance the scale-up of home and community-based diagnosis and treatment with rigorous supervision, ongoing quality assurance, and community engagement to ensure effectiveness, safety, and equity of malaria care. Integrating these approaches with broader health systems strengthening and community health initiatives (including iCCM for other febrile illnesses) will be important for long-term sustainability and improved health outcomes.
