The results of our study investigating the effects of participation in the Mind Body Medicine (MBM) program on stress, depression, and empathy in medical students offer important insights into the challenges faced by students during their training, and the potential benefits of wellness interventions. Our findings align with existing literature suggesting that medical students experience heightened levels of stress and depression, coupled with a decline in empathy as they progress through their education. 

Despite the statistical significance in the increase of depression levels among the control group, it is notable that students participating in the MBM program did not exhibit a similar rise in depression symptoms. This suggests that MBM participation may buffer students from some of the adverse emotional effects typically exacerbated during the first year of medical school. However, although there was an increase in perceived stress and a decrease in empathy in both groups, the MBM program did not significantly alter these outcomes. This reinforces existing literature which indicates that despite efforts to cultivate empathy through curricular changes or supportive interventions, students still face systemic pressures that contribute to emotional distress and empathy decline.

The increase in PSS scores across both groups emphasizes that regardless of intervention, medical students face substantial stressors inherent to their training. Stress in medical education can stem from various sources—academic rigor, exposure to emotionally charged clinical environments, and interpersonal conflicts. The pressure to maintain high academic performance while navigating rigorous clinical engagements likely contributes to the stagnation or decline of empathy among medical students. 

Empathy, a cornerstone of effective patient-physician relationships and professional practice, appears vulnerable in the face of these stressors. The findings of our study indicate that, even with participation in a program designed to foster well-being, the decline in empathy persisted, which points to complex and multifaceted challenges within the medical education system. Additionally, the lack of significant baseline differences in empathy scores between the MBM and non-MBM groups further suggests that a single intervention may not suffice in addressing the broader issues at play. 

The fact that students in the MBM course did not experience the same rise in depression symptoms highlights the need for curricular interventions like MBM that promote resilience and mental health. The encouragement of wellness practices, alongside academic training, could be essential in fostering not only personal well-being but also professional competency.

Importantly, the results underscore the need for a more systemic approach to address medical student well-being. Future research should take a longitudinal approach that examines the effect of sustained participation in wellness programs on empathy and mental health throughout medical training. Moreover, incorporating feedback mechanisms into these programs could help refine their effectiveness and ensure they are meeting the needs of medical students.

In summary, our findings indicate that while the MBM program may support aspects of student mental health, significant challenges, including stress and empathy decline, persist during medical training. A comprehensive strategy integrating wellness practices with academic training is vital in nurturing a compassionate physician workforce equipped to face the demands of the profession. The road ahead requires collaborative efforts from educators and administrators to create an environment conducive to fostering resilience, empathy, and overall well-being among future health care providers.
