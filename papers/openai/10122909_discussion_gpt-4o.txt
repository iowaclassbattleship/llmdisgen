The proposed approach introduces the Angle Embedded Gait Dynamic Image (AE-GDI) as an innovative 2D representation of gait patterns, leveraging inertial sensor data to maximize robustness and accuracy in gait recognition tasks. The AE-GDI’s effectiveness lies in its orientation and translation invariance, which is achieved by encoding gait dynamics in three-dimensional space using angles, thus avoiding pitfalls associated with raw sensor data transformations and subsequent data normalization processes. This novel representation, when coupled with a convolutional neural network (CNN), transitions the gait recognition challenge from a time-series problem to a more tractable image recognition problem, utilizing CNN's prowess in feature extraction and pattern recognition.

The integration of a grid-based method for detecting gait cycle starting positions enhances the preprocessing robustness by dealing with issues inherent in sliding-window approaches, which often disregard significant data points. This method aligns well with the periodic characteristics of gait cycles, ensuring accurate segmentation—an essential feature for reliable AE-GDI generation.

Empirical evaluation on two datasets validates the model's superiority in both gait authentication and labeling tasks. On the McGill dataset, which emulates real-world conditions more accurately, the proposed approach exhibits higher accuracy compared to baseline methods. Notably, results improve with longer sequences of data, though this must be balanced against the potential variability introduced by changes in subject conditions across different days. Analysis on the OU-ISIR dataset, despite its shorter sequence lengths, demonstrates the model's aptitude in handling a large number of subjects, a critical factor for robust multi-subject gait labeling.

However, it is crucial to recognize some limitations. The model's sensitivity to sensor placement, although reduced, remains an influencing factor, warranting further exploration into methodologies that can accommodate variable sensor positions or data conditions. Additionally, as the proposed approach inherently increases computational complexity due to AE-GDI generation, optimizations to the CNN architecture and potential incorporation of other deep learning methodologies, like convolutional recurrent neural networks, present viable paths for enhancing performance.

Future work will need to focus on broadening dataset diversity to further establish the generalizability of these findings. Moreover, exploring real-time applications where lightweight and efficient models are paramount could significantly expand the utility of wearable sensor-based gait recognition systems, aligning with the evolving landscape of ubiquitous computing.
