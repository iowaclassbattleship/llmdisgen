### Discussion

The current work demonstrates a significant advance in the design and in vivo application of glucose biofuel cells (GBFCs) as potential power sources for implantable medical devices. By employing compressed carbon nanotube (CNT)-enzyme composite electrodes, this study addresses multiple historical challenges in implantable biofuel cell technology, including low power output, stability, and biocompatibility.

**Comparison to Prior Art and Innovations**

Historically, implantable battery-powered devices have been constrained by the need for periodic replacement surgeries, device size, and longevity concerns. The transition from abiotic to enzymatic biofuel cells provided better specificity and operation under physiological conditions but generally suffered from low power outputs and insufficient operational lifetime in vivo {{14887567}}. Previous work, including the first demonstration of a GBFC implanted in a rat, showed proof of concept, but voltage and power density were insufficient for practical device operation.

This study’s core technological advance lies in the mechanical compression of CNT/enzyme mixtures, enabling high surface area, enhanced electron transfer, and improved enzyme immobilization. The result is a GBFC with a substantial increase in open-circuit voltage (up to 660 mV), sustained power output suitable for driving real electronic devices (such as LEDs and digital thermometers), and operational stability over several weeks—parameters that approach the minimal requirements for practical biomedical device support.

**Electrochemical and Physiological Performance**

The electrochemical characterization shows that the new GBFC design reaches OCVs of 510–660 mV, with the ability to supply discharge currents up to 700 μA cm⁻² for at least 10 minutes—outperforming previous in vivo reports {{14887567}}. The system demonstrates efficient recovery of equilibrium after discharge, indicating a robust self-regeneration of local substrate (glucose and oxygen) concentrations at the electrode interface.

Power management circuitry, using a boost converter, allowed the cell to intermittently power devices with much higher voltage requirements than the GBFC’s intrinsic OCV, showcasing the feasibility of direct application in medical electronics. The intermittent, capacitor-based energy delivery further aligns with the low duty-cycle operation typical of many medical devices (e.g., pacemakers, sensors), mitigating the issue of limited instantaneous power output.

**Biocompatibility and Histological Response**

Biocompatibility is a leading concern for any implantable device. The observed encapsulation of the GBFC in vascularized, non-inflammatory tissue over periods up to 110 days, with no significant adverse effects on rat weight or feeding behavior (outside of the immediate postsurgical period), highlights the promise of the Dacron and medical-grade silicone encapsulation strategy. However, it is important to note that long-term electrochemical operation could not be assessed beyond 9 days due to connection loss, so the bioelectrochemical biocompatibility beyond acute phases remains to be rigorously established.

**Comparison with Other GBFC Architectures**

Compared to earlier in vivo GBFCs using mechanically confined enzymes and mediators without CNTs {{14887567}}, the CNT-based electrodes displayed here offer increased electron transfer rates, improved enzyme wiring, and higher operational stability. While prior designs limited by the use of redox mediators such as ubiquinone or quinone derivatives suffer from mediator diffusion, pH sensitivity, and biocompatibility issues, the mediatorless, direct electron transfer pathway provided by the CNT-improved electrodes addresses many of these limitations.

Moreover, historical limitations of laccase as a cathodic enzyme, particularly regarding chloride and urate inhibition in physiological fluid {{971289}}, are partially overcome by demonstrating sufficient activity of immobilized laccase under these conditions, albeit at reduced (but still relevant) specific activities.

**Limitations and Future Directions**

Despite this progress, several important limitations remain. The GBFC’s long-term operational stability in vivo remains to be confirmed, particularly regarding enzyme degradation, fouling, and foreign body encapsulation. Electrode connection failures indicate a need for improved device packaging and surgical interface stability for chronic studies. Additionally, while a single GBFC of 0.24 mL (2.4 mL total implant) could intermittently power a low-consumption device, scaling to devices requiring continuous power or higher energy demand will require further increases in power density.

Cycle-lifetime studies and chronic device implantation in larger animals, with rigorous health and histological assessments, will be necessary before translation toward human applications. Furthermore, the efficiency and specificity of the enzymatic system must be reconciled with the challenges of immune responses, fibrosis, and local microenvironment shifts upon long-term implantation.

**Conclusion**

This study delivers an in vivo demonstration that mediatorless GBFCs based on compressed CNT/enzyme electrodes can generate sustained power directly from physiological substrates to drive medical electronics, with evidence of biocompatibility and device stability in the acute phase. The results support the feasibility of GBFCs as long-term, autonomous power sources for next-generation medical implants, provided further work optimizes long-term stability, device integration, and in vivo electrochemical performance. This constitutes a meaningful step toward addressing the major challenge of durable, maintenance-free power supplies in biomedical device technology.
