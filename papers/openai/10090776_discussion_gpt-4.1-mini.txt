The integration of MRI data into the intraoperative TRUS imaging framework via elastic surface-based registration significantly enhances prostate delineation accuracy in the context of brachytherapy treatment planning. Our results demonstrate that MRI/TRUS data fusion leads to a consistent increase in prostate volume measurements relative to TRUS alone, primarily by improving segmentation at the prostate apex and base—regions traditionally challenging to visualize in TRUS. This volume increase averaged approximately 15.86%, with some patients exhibiting differences as high as nearly 50%. These findings align with previous observations that TRUS can underestimate prostate extent, particularly at gland extremities, and highlight the value of complementary imaging to improve anatomical definition.

The improved registration accuracy, as quantitatively validated by residual surface distances averaging close to 1 mm and by the reduced urethral positional discrepancies after elastic registration, confirms the robustness of the combined rigid-elastic methodology. Although urethral distance errors were higher near the apex—likely reflective of the greater imaging difficulty and manual segmentation variability in this region—the overall registration precision is within clinically acceptable margins for guiding treatment. The elastic registration’s ability to capture localized prostate deformations beyond rigid transformations is advantageous, given the organ’s deformable nature and the potential for shape changes between imaging sessions.

Importantly, the implications of enhanced prostate volume definition on dosimetry are substantial. Dose-volume histogram (DVH) analysis revealed that the dose coverage to the prostate, expressed as the volume receiving at least the target dose (160 Gy), was systematically lower when considering MRI+US contours compared to TRUS alone, though all patients still met clinical dose constraints. This dose reduction is directly attributable to increased prostate volume, causing some parts of the gland—especially at the apex and base—to fall outside the high-dose region planned based on smaller TRUS volumes. The observed strong correlation (Spearman coefficient 0.904) between volume increase and dose decrease underscores the critical influence of anatomical delineation on dosimetric accuracy. Such discrepancies could potentially lead to underdosing of tumor-bearing tissues if MRI information is not integrated into planning.

Our data suggest that conventional TRUS-based prostate delineation risks overestimating the delivered dose due to underestimation of gland size, which might partially explain variable clinical outcomes and local recurrence rates reported in some brachytherapy series. By incorporating MRI data to refine prostate boundaries, treatment planning becomes more reliable, allowing the actual dose delivered to better reflect the prescribed plan. This improvement is particularly relevant for ensuring coverage of the entire gland while minimizing exposure to adjacent organs at risk.

Furthermore, the approach of performing MRI acquisition pre-operatively and fusing it with intraoperative TRUS images circumvents the logistical and infrastructural challenges associated with performing brachytherapy inside open interventional MR systems, which remain limited to specialized centers. The PROCUR system thus represents a practical method for improving imaging guidance during seed implantation without disrupting established clinical workflows. The interactive composite imaging interface providing simultaneous visualization of MRI and TRUS data enhances clinician confidence in contouring and seed placement.

Nonetheless, several limitations and future directions are noted. Our current dataset is relatively small (eight patients) and preliminary; larger studies are necessary to validate clinical impact, including correlations with post-treatment PSA levels and long-term oncological outcomes. Additionally, while this work focused primarily on prostate volume and dose coverage, comprehensive evaluation of doses delivered to critical adjacent structures such as the urethra and rectum is required to fully assess potential benefits and risks of the fused imaging approach. Automation and standardization of segmentation protocols could reduce variability and improve reproducibility.

In conclusion, MRI/TRUS data fusion substantially improves prostate delineation accuracy in brachytherapy planning, offering a more faithful representation of gland anatomy that affects dose distribution calculations. This technique has the potential to enhance treatment precision, optimize therapeutic outcomes, and mitigate toxicities by ensuring adherence to dosimetric constraints. Further clinical validation and technical refinements may establish MRI/TRUS fusion as a standard adjunct to TRUS-based prostate brachytherapy.
