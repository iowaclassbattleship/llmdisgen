In this study, we addressed the re-translation sense problem in extracting paraphrases of German particle verbs (PVs) using a graph-based clustering approach. Our aim was to improve on the limitations of the standard re-translation method by focusing on both aspects: the inability to distinguish between senses and the bias towards frequent senses. Our results indicate that incorporating distributional similarity into the ranking mechanism is highly effective, with or without explicitly using cluster information from graphical methods. 

The incorporation of graph-based clustering aimed at discerning distinct senses by grouping synonym candidates into clusters. The method, heavily inspired by the work of {{11942888}}, involves creating a fully connected graph of synonym candidates and iterating the clustering process to successively refine cluster boundaries. However, despite the initial focus on improving sense coverage via graph clustering, the most substantial improvements in ranking accuracy stemmed from including distributional similarity information. Our findings align with those of {{1588782}}, who also emphasized integrating contextual similarity for sense discrimination.

Notably, the extended system with distributional similarity alone already approached the top precision levels, which suggests that the intrinsic power of simple distributional measures plays a key role in recognizing polysemous contexts more than previously appreciated. This echoes {{2755801}} and Wittmann et al. (2014), who integrated similar distributional constraints into paraphrase extraction tasks to enhance outcomes.

The apparent diminishing returns of further clustering iterations (beyond the first iteration) imply that our initial thresholding may already capture much of the pertinent synonym candidate groupings. The failure of successive iterations to improve precision or sense coverage could result from an overly aggressive division of candidates that end up reducing interpretive stability.

These results have broader implications for sense discrimination in paraphrase databases beyond German PVs, suggesting that a balanced combination of simple distributional similarity and minimal clustering may suffice for achieving high retrieval accuracy in similar contexts. Furthermore, they provide a groundwork for future research to explore alternative scoring algorithms that could further refine the extraction and ranking without relying on computationally intensive clustering processes.

Looking ahead, this research opens potential avenues for enhancing SMT capabilities and query expansion systems through a refined method of paraphrase extraction that leverages straightforward yet effective contextual and distributional measurements. Adjusting the balance between clustering complexity and practicality will remain crucial for real-world applications.
