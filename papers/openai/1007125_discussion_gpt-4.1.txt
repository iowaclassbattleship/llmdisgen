**Discussion**

The results of our study support the development and utility of an information-theoretic model for predicting transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), with a particular emphasis on incorporating position interdependencies. The analysis yielded several key insights when compared to existing approaches and published findings in the field.

**1. Limitations of Traditional Models and the Need for Interdependencies**

Traditional computational methods, especially position weight matrix (PWM)-based models, have been widespread due to their simplicity and interpretability. However, these models largely rely on the independence assumption, where each nucleotide position contributes additively and independently to binding affinity. While this assumption facilitates modeling and reduces the number of parameters required, it can lead to both high false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) rates, especially for degenerate motifs or sites where base interdependencies are biologically significant {{9363757}}. Several studies now provide experimental and computational evidence that interdependencies between motif positions can strongly influence binding specificity and affinity {{14355663}}, {{14628039}}, {{36684637}}, {{37555511}}. Ignoring these dependencies can thus compromise predictive accuracy.

Our results confirm these findings: using an independence assumption (i.e., r=1 in our model), predictions are abundant but less accurate, as indicated by high FP rates. Incorporating two-way and higher interdependencies (r ≥ 2) results in a substantial reduction in predicted sites while markedly increasing accuracy, highlighting the value of modeling such dependencies.

**2. Information Transfer as a Criterion for TFBS Prediction**

This work introduces a novel criterion—a threshold of the information transferred (TI) between TF and TFBS—for site identification. In contrast to relative entropy thresholds commonly used in PWM-based models, our model’s use of TI as a binding criterion is both more mechanistically grounded (relating directly to the concept of information necessary for specific recognition) and objectively defined (via minimum transferred information, MTI). The empirical observation that most real TFBSs in S. cerevisiae have TI values above zero validates the underlying hypothesis that TF binding is an information transmission process, in line with information-theoretic approaches to sequence analysis {{5747983}}, {{5504524}}, {{11167034}}.

**3. Effective Incorporation of Correlation Structures**

An important advantage of our model is its flexible handling of base correlations. The mathematical framework provides not only a concrete means of quantifying positive and negative dependencies among positions but also a mechanism to estimate information content more accurately than under the independence assumption. The empirical tests—on both real TFBSs and artificially-generated sites—demonstrate that models incorporating r-way correlations (r ≥ 2) significantly outperform independence-based models, particularly as r increases from 1 to 2. However, additional accuracy gains from increasing r beyond 3 are marginal, while computational complexity increases rapidly, consistent with prior computational studies that weigh trade-offs between model complexity and performance {{6512203}}, {{6355740}}.

**4. Generalizability and Robustness in Data-Limited Settings**

Notably, our model maintains strong performance even when only partial knowledge of a TF’s binding sites is available, identifying nearly half of the real sites when trained on just 25% of known TFBSs and doing so without a notable increase in FP rate. This robustness to data limitation is particularly important in eukaryotic genomes, where experimentally-verified binding sites are often sparse. These results suggest our approach is less prone to overfitting, likely because of its objective, information-based thresholding, and its focus on base correlations that are stable features of TFBS architecture.

**5. Comparison to Existing Motif-Finding Methods**

Our method, as implemented in tfbsInfoScanner, was benchmarked against widely-used motif identification algorithms such as SOMBRERO {{14628039}}, MEME {{7117788}}, and AlignACE {{23756127}}. Consistently, the information transmission model achieved equal or superior performance, especially with moderate or greater training set coverage (≥50%). While some alternative approaches incorporate structural or higher-order models of protein-DNA interaction {{9363757}}, such methods often require data not routinely available, limiting their practical utility. Pattern recognition-based techniques (e.g., SVMs {{18256527}}, Bayesian networks {{263729}}) can infer complex dependencies but may lack biophysical interpretability.

In tests on artificial data, our method was adept at distinguishing real TFBSs with substantial base correlations from pseudo-motifs (generated using PWMs under independence assumptions), again underscoring its sensitivity to structural features likely missed by PWM approaches. Interestingly, when r=1, all pseudo-TFBSs were detected (analogous to PWM models), but with high FP rates. At r=3, real TFBSs were correctly identified with a much lower FP rate, further validating the utility of incorporating dependencies.

**6. Biological and Theoretical Relevance**

Our approach conceptually aligns with current understanding in molecular biophysics and gene regulation: protein-DNA binding is mediated by both direct base-specific recognition and DNA shape, both featuring base interdependencies {{9363757}}. The information transfer model unifies these perspectives by treating binding as a process in which sufficient information must be conveyed from the sequence to the protein to achieve specific recognition, and by quantifying the minimum informational requirement for site discrimination.

**7. Limitations and Prospects**

Despite clear advantages, our model’s ability to capture all forms of higher-order base dependencies is constrained by the curse of dimensionality: as r increases, parameter estimation requires exponentially more data. This may restrict the application to sufficiently large TFBS datasets for specific TFs or require careful feature/model selection strategies {{6355740}}. Additionally, performance remains linked to the quality of background models, motif alignment, and the completeness of known sites.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, this study presents and validates an information-theoretic model for TFBS prediction that explicitly incorporates base interdependencies with demonstrably superior predictive performance to existing methods based on the independence assumption. The model is robust to limited training data, reduces FP and FN rates, and is biophysically interpretable. Further work may focus on efficient estimation of higher-order dependencies from sparse data, extension to other genomes and TF families, and integration with structural and comparative genomic information for comprehensive regulatory element annotation.
