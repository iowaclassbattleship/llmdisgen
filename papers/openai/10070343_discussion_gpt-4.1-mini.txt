The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of participation in an 11-week Mind Body Medicine (MBM) elective course on first-year medical students’ empathy, perceived stress, and depression levels. The key findings indicated that while stress increased and empathy decreased over the course of the first year in medical school—findings consistent with prior literature—participation in the MBM course did not significantly alter these trajectories in comparison to controls. However, a noteworthy outcome was that depression scores significantly increased in the control group but not among MBM participants, suggesting a potential protective effect of the MBM intervention against worsening depressive symptoms.

These findings align with established data demonstrating high rates of stress, depression, and declining empathy in medical students during training, which are hypothesized to be influenced by both curricular and personal factors (Hojat et al., 2004; Bellini and Shea, 2005). The observed increase in perceived stress scores in both groups underscores the robust and pervasive stressors inherent to the early medical school experience. Similarly, the decline in empathy measured by the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy – Students (JSPE-S) reflects the pattern reported in multiple studies, reinforcing concerns regarding empathy erosion during medical education (Hojat et al., 2004; Newton et al., 2000).

Of particular significance is the differential effect observed in depression scores, where the MBM group did not experience the statistically significant rise seen in controls. This suggests that MBM practices, which promote self-awareness and coping skills through meditation, guided imagery, and journaling, may confer resilience or mitigation of depressive symptomatology, a finding supported by previous investigations linking mindfulness and stress-reduction techniques to improved mental health outcomes in medical trainees (Ball and Bax, 2002; Novack et al., 1999). The absence of a corresponding effect on stress or empathy may reflect either the limited sample size of the current pilot study or potentially differential pathways influencing these constructs.

The lack of significant between-group differences in empathy and stress could also be due to several factors. First, the relatively small matched sample size (n=20) limits statistical power to detect subtle effects. Second, empathy and stress are complex, multifactorial phenomena potentially influenced by numerous curricular and environmental factors beyond those targeted by the MBM course. Third, measurement timing post-intervention may not capture longer-term benefits or delayed effects on empathy retention or stress modulation.

The current results contribute important preliminary data that complement broader literature exploring the relationships among distress, well-being, and empathy in medical students. Larger-scale and longitudinal research (e.g., Shanafelt et al., 2005; Dyrbye et al., 2005) has emphasized that empathy decline is associated with burnout dimensions such as depersonalization and emotional exhaustion, rather than depression alone, and that enhancing quality of life and personal accomplishment may support empathy preservation. The MBM program’s focus on self-care and stress management aligns conceptually with efforts aimed at fostering well-being, which may in turn sustain professionalism and compassionate care (Novack et al., 1997; Epstein, 1999; Shanafelt et al., 2005).

Limitations of this study include the small sample size with high attrition at post-test, reliance on self-selected participation which may introduce selection bias, and utilization of self-report instruments that, while validated, serve as indirect proxies for complex constructs. Future investigations should incorporate larger samples with randomized designs, longitudinal assessments extending beyond the first year, and incorporation of objective measures of empathy and clinical performance. Furthermore, exploration of mediators and moderators such as baseline mental health status, coping styles, and curricular climate would deepen understanding of intervention effects.

In conclusion, participation in the MBM elective may attenuate the increase in depressive symptoms commonly observed in first-year medical students, though it does not appear to influence the general pattern of increasing stress and declining empathy over the first year. These preliminary findings underscore the potential value of integrating mind-body approaches within medical education curricula to support student mental health. They also highlight the need for comprehensive strategies that address multiple facets of distress and well-being to effectively sustain empathy and professional development. Continued research is warranted to optimize and validate such interventions, with the ultimate goal of promoting physician well-being and enhancing patient-centered care.
