**Discussion**

The current case report highlights the use of everolimus-based immunosuppressive therapy following liver transplantation, particularly in the context of acute renal insufficiency and complex vascular reconstruction. This approach is supported by the growing body of evidence showing that minimization of calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) exposure in favor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, such as everolimus, may effectively preserve renal function without compromising graft or patient outcomes {{18859011}}.

The patient described presented with high operative risk factors, including a high MELD score, significant intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative vascular complications requiring an extra-anatomic aortoiliac-hepatic arterial graft. Following early post-transplant acute renal failure, the conversion from a standard CNI-based regimen to an everolimus-based protocol aimed to limit further nephrotoxicity while maintaining adequate immunosuppression.

This approach is well aligned with the findings from the randomized controlled trial by Fischer et al., in which early introduction of everolimus with reduced tacrolimus exposure led to superior renal function at one year post-transplant compared to standard-dose tacrolimus, while maintaining noninferior rates of the composite efficacy endpoint (treated biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, or death) {{18859011}}. In that study, the everolimus + reduced tacrolimus group demonstrated a significant preservation of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), with a mean difference of 8.5 mL/min/1.73m² at 12 months relative to standard therapy. Importantly, episodes of acute rejection were not increased under the reduced CNI exposure protocol, and no new safety concerns emerged.

Notably, the greatest benefit from early CNI minimization and mTOR inhibitor introduction seems to occur when therapy is initiated before irreversible kidney injury has occurred, as supported by conversion studies showing limited renal recovery once significant dysfunction is established {{18859011}}. Thus, the case report's early switch to everolimus in the presence of acute renal failure reflects a strategy designed to mitigate progression of kidney injury, which can be a decisive factor for long-term outcomes after liver transplantation.

In contrast, the use of everolimus is not without risk. Adverse events characteristic of mTOR inhibitors, including impaired wound healing, vascular anastomosis complications, and thrombotic microangiopathy, have been observed, especially when therapy is introduced in the early postoperative period or in the context of concurrent surgical complications. In the present report, careful monitoring and timely percutaneous drainage of intra-abdominal collections, together with vigilant vascular surveillance, were essential to patient management. These complications correspond to those described in the literature, where everolimus-related adverse effects typically include peripheral edema, leukopenia, and, less commonly, wound healing complications {{18859011}}.

The case also illustrates successful management in a complex clinical scenario (high MELD, HCV/alcohol cirrhosis, acute renal dysfunction, extra-anatomic arterial reconstruction), with good long-term graft and renal function at 8 months post-transplant. This outcome is consistent with the growing evidence base for personalized, kidney-sparing immunosuppressive protocols, particularly in high-risk patients.

Several limitations should be noted. As a single case, generalizability is limited, and continued vigilance is required for long-term safety and efficacy monitoring. In addition, while early introduction of everolimus proved beneficial in this patient, such strategies may not be universally applicable, especially where primary surgical healing is at risk or when vascular supply is tenuous.

In summary, this case supports the concept that early everolimus initiation with CNI minimization is a feasible strategy for high-risk liver transplant recipients, even in complex surgical scenarios, provided that indications, risks, and vigilant monitoring are accounted for. This individualized approach is substantiated by recent clinical trial evidence and offers a promising avenue to improve both graft and patient outcomes by preserving renal function and minimizing long-term toxicity {{18859011}}. Future directions include prospective studies of everolimus initiation timing and evaluation of long-term patient-centered outcomes in diverse transplant populations.
