The present study provides compelling evidence that fibronectin in the walls of blood vessels is produced locally by endothelial cells rather than being derived solely from plasma fibronectin circulating in the bloodstream. Using a rat-to-mouse skin xenograft model combined with reciprocal species-specific anti-fibronectin antibodies, we demonstrated that fibronectin associated with donor rat blood vessels within the graft stain specifically with anti-rat fibronectin antibodies. In contrast, antibodies against mouse fibronectin failed to label fibronectin in these rat vessels near the wound edge, indicating an absence of recipient-derived fibronectin deposition. This specificity was rigorously validated by control staining in normal mouse skin microvasculature and by absorption controls that abrogated cross-reactivity, confirming the accuracy of the immunofluorescence approach.

The observation that fibronectin expression is markedly upregulated in donor vessel walls within 0.5 mm of the wound edge as early as 2 days post-injury further implicates local synthesis associated with endothelial cell activation and proliferation during vascular repair. The morphological changes noted in endothelial cells, including nuclear swelling, open chromatin, cytoplasmic bulging, and the presence of mitotic figures, corroborate a proliferative phenotype consistent with ongoing neovascularization and tissue remodeling. The increased incorporation of [³H]thymidine not only confirms endothelial proliferation but also suggests a critical window during which fibronectin synthesis may play a role in supporting endothelial cell adhesion, migration, and matrix assembly.

These findings align well with prior work demonstrating that fibronectin—a multifunctional extracellular matrix glycoprotein—is crucial for cell adhesion, spreading, and migration, especially during wound healing and angiogenesis (Engvall and Ruoslahti, 1977; Ruoslahti and Engvall, 1978). Our data extend these observations by demonstrating that endothelial cells themselves contribute fibronectin locally during microvascular proliferation, rather than passively incorporating plasma fibronectin. This distinction is significant as it implies a cell-regulated mechanism for fibronectin fibrillogenesis that may differ from plasma fibronectin properties, a concept supported by previous biochemical analyses indicating subtle but relevant differences between plasma and cellular fibronectin isoforms (Yamada and Kennedy, 1979).

The use of species-specific antibodies allowed dissection of the origins of fibronectin in a complex in vivo setting and highlights the importance of localized fibronectin synthesis in vascular regeneration. Notably, at the interface region between graft and host skin, the microvasculature expressed exclusively donor- or host-specific fibronectin, confirming that vessels retain their species origin and that fibronectin production remains an intrinsic cellular property rather than a result of circulating protein incorporation.

Furthermore, the demonstration that circulating fibronectin from fetal bovine serum can be incorporated into the extracellular matrix in vitro (as shown in the companion culture studies) indicates that plasma fibronectin is capable of matrix assembly under certain cellular conditions. However, in vivo, the data suggest that endothelial cells actively synthesize fibronectin to fulfill the needs of a dynamically remodeling vascular niche. This local synthesis likely contributes critical adhesive and structural cues necessary for endothelial migration and capillary tube formation.

In summary, these results underscore the functional importance of endothelial cell-derived fibronectin in the wound healing response and microvascular proliferation. The cellular control of fibronectin production at the site of injury may provide a mechanism to regulate matrix composition and cell behavior precisely during tissue repair. Future investigations should focus on elucidating the molecular signals that induce fibronectin gene expression in endothelial cells during angiogenesis and determining how these processes differ from the roles played by plasma fibronectin. Such insights may reveal therapeutic targets to enhance or modulate vascular repair in pathological conditions.
