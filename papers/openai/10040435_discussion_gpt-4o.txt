The study highlights the complex interplay between socio-economic, cultural, and structural factors influencing malaria management in Bo, Sierra Leone, emphasizing the increased preference for home-based testing, particularly in rural areas. The research illuminates crucial insights into the malaria diagnosis preferences, underscoring the substantial inclination towards home-based testing over laboratory-based testing due to various determinants. 

Rural participants significantly favored home-based testing facilitated by community health volunteers (CHVs), reflecting its perceived convenience and accessibility. This preference illustrates the logistical and economic dynamics influencing health-seeking behaviors, considering the barriers such as distance to healthcare facilities and limited financial resources faced by rural communities. Contrarily, urban participants displayed a more balanced view, with a marginal preference towards laboratory testing, suggesting either a greater trust in facility-based healthcare or less restrictive access barriers.

The socio-economic disparities between urban and rural participants are stark, with rural residents reporting lower education levels, reduced literacy rates, and poorer quality of life perceptions. These disparities have critical implications for health interventions, as socio-economic determinants play a substantial role in shaping healthcare decisions and access. This urban-rural divide also reflects on the different strategies required to effectively implement healthcare programs that address unique community needs and socioeconomic contexts.

The findings pointed out significant gender and education-related influences on testing preferences. Interestingly, greater education levels in urban areas correlated with a preference for lab-based testing, highlighting the role of education in health literacy and decision-making processes. Furthermore, confidence in self-performed tests was consistently higher among those advocating for home-based testing, suggesting the potential effectiveness of empowering communities through adequate education and training in self-diagnosis methods.

The research further disclosed a prevalent inclination towards presuming the cause of fever as malaria without testing, leading to self-medication practices. This trend underscores the critical need for strengthening public health education to improve awareness and understanding of the accurate diagnosis and treatment of malaria to curtail unwarranted medication and its associated risks.

It is notable that financial incentives to perform home-based tests were largely supported by respondents, emphasizing how cost-related factors are pivotal in the acceptance and scaling of health interventions. This economic perspective suggests a significant avenue to explore in improving diagnostic uptake and potentially reducing healthcare disparities.

In conclusion, this study accentuates the necessity for tailored interventions that address specific community challenges, prioritizing rural areas where access barriers are heightened. The increased acceptance of home-based malaria testing, contingent on proper training and economic incentives, casts light on potential strategies to improve malaria diagnosis and effectively reduce the prevalence of presumptive treatment practices. These insights pave the way for enhanced healthcare delivery models that incorporate economic, educational, and accessibility considerations to better align with community needs, thereby improving health outcomes significantly within underserved populations.
