**Discussion**

The present study investigated the dosimetric impact of MRI/TRUS data fusion for prostate delineation in the context of permanent seed brachytherapy, building on previous technical validation of the fusion approach {{128063}}. Our findings indicate that the integration of preoperative MRI with intraoperative TRUS datasets leads to systematic increases in prostate volume estimates, particularly in the apex and base regions—areas known for poor TRUS visualization and high inter- and intra-observer variability. This outcome is consistent with earlier observations that MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast and enables more consistent and complete gland delineation {{128063}}.

The observed increase in prostate volumes by an average of approximately 16%, with substantial variability across patients, directly translates to clinically meaningful changes in estimated dosimetric coverage. In nearly all studied cases, the proportion of prostate volume encompassed by the prescribed 160 Gy isodose (the clinical D90 goal) was reduced after data fusion, even though all cases still satisfied the minimum recommended threshold. The high correlation (Spearman coefficient: 0.904) between volume increase and reduction in dose coverage underscores the clinical relevance of imaging-based prostate definition.

The main dosimetric consequence, as suggested by our results, is a likely overestimation of delivered dose when relying solely on TRUS-based contouring. Specifically, under-segmentation of the prostate with TRUS may result in planning for a smaller target volume, inadvertently increasing the risk of geographic miss and under-dosage to subtler anatomical extensions, especially at the gland’s cranial and caudal poles. While the current planning still met minimum dosimetric constraints in this small cohort, near-threshold cases (such as patient 5) draw attention to a potential for under-treatment if imaging/contouring inaccuracies are not addressed.

Previous technical assessments with phantoms and patient data confirm that the implemented elastic surface registration achieves sub-millimeter mean residual fit (mean ~1.1 mm) for both surface and urethral landmarks, with errors being smallest in the mid-gland and increasing toward the apex {{128063}}. This spatial trend in registration error likely contributes modest additional uncertainty in dosimetric mapping, yet is significantly less than the variability introduced by segmentation alone. These findings support that, from a technical standpoint, MRI/TRUS registration is robust and that most clinical impact arises from improved anatomical definition rather than from misregistration per se.

Our data also reinforce and extend results from analogous studies in the literature. While previous groups have used manual or landmark-based fusion approaches {{24290947}}, our implementation of combined rigid and non-rigid (octree-spline) surface registration enables both global and local alignment, further reducing the risk of systematic anatomical mismatch. Importantly, by allowing real-time visualization and interactive editing of fused images during planning, our workflow supports both verification and refinement, thus potentially reducing inter-observer variability and improving consistency in clinical practice.

Several limitations merit discussion. First, the patient sample size remains limited, restricting detailed statistical analysis and limiting robust assessment of the impact on urethral and rectal dose constraints. Second, fusion was performed post-operatively rather than prospectively guiding the clinical plan, precluding direct assessment of workflow feasibility and immediate clinical outcomes. Third, while urethra was used as a landmark for registration validation, clinical evaluation of OAR (Organs At Risk) dose—urethral and rectal dosimetry—was not systematically assessed in this series. Additional investigation with larger prospective cohorts is required to evaluate potential trade-offs between improved prostate coverage and increased risk to OARs.

Future work should focus on several key areas. First, extension to a larger patient cohort will enable more rigorous statistical testing and help determine the true incidence of under-dosage when using TRUS-only planning. Second, direct analysis of OAR dosimetry—urethra and rectum—following data fusion is needed to ensure that dose escalation or improved coverage is not achieved at the expense of increased toxicity risk. Third, integration of MRI/TRUS fusion into real-time intraoperative planning could help further mitigate spatial uncertainties and promote adaptive dose optimization. Finally, the impact of more accurate gland definition on clinical endpoints, such as biochemical control and toxicity rates, should be evaluated in longitudinal follow-up.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that MRI/TRUS data fusion improves the geometric definition of the prostate gland in brachytherapy treatment planning and exposes systematic overestimation of dose coverage when planning is based on TRUS alone. Routine use of MRI-enhanced segmentation could enhance dosimetric accuracy, improve patient safety, and ultimately contribute to more reliable treatment outcomes. These results support growing consensus in the field regarding the value of multiparametric imaging for image-guided prostate cancer therapy and encourage continued development of integrated, workflow-efficient fusion systems.
