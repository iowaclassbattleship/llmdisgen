The application of regression models within the context of scalar responses and functional predictors, particularly functional linear models (FLMs), has demonstrated substantial viability across various domains, most notably in climatology and biology. Traditional FLMs, however, face limitations when attempting to capture heterogeneous relationships where the association between predictors and responses varies across subpopulations. This paper advances this discourse through the lens of functional mixture regression (FMR) models, which utilize finite mixture models to address these complexities by identifying distinct subpopulation-specific regression structures.

The introduction of wavelet-based (WB) approaches to FMR modeling as proposed in this study marks a noteworthy development. Wavelets provide the versatility needed to decompose functional data into multiple scales, thus preserving both local and global functional characteristics. These approaches exploit the inherent capacity of wavelets to handle discontinuities and rapid changes, making them especially suitable for high-dimensional data scenarios, such as those involving image data.

This research employs a strategic integration of wavelets and lasso-type penalization. By representing each functional predictor and response relationship using a wavelet basis, the model leverages lasso penalties to enforce sparsity in high-dimensional spaces, a necessity when handling large coefficient vector sizes resultant from discretized functional predictors. The methodological rigor in applying this penalty is crucial for obtaining stable and interpretable model estimates, addressing overfitting, and enhancing computational feasibility.

Simulation studies presented in the paper elucidate the relative advantages of the WB and adaptive wavelet-based (AWB) methods over traditional functional principal component-based approaches, particularly under conditions with varying signal complexity. For functional relationships exhibiting intricate, localized variability ("bumpy" settings), the wavelet-based methodologies demonstrate superior predictive accuracy and parameter estimation fidelity.

In a practical application, the wavelet-based FMR approach was employed to analyze the relationship between fractional anisotropy profiles of the corpus callosum and cognitive functioning in subjects with multiple sclerosis. The findings suggest differential associations across subpopulations, highlighting the nuanced understanding FMR models facilitate in investigating complex biological phenomena.

Despite demonstrating considerable promise, the transition from theoretical and simulation settings to real-world applications necessitates careful consideration of wavelet and mixture model tuning parameters—component number, wavelet decomposition level, and penalty strength—which were addressed using data-driven methodologies like cross-validation and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The exploration of how these parameters impact model performance ensures the robustness and reliability of the FMR model outputs.

The paper concludes by acknowledging the innovation presented through wavelet-based FMR models, especially in adapting to data heterogeneity without explicit subpopulation labels. Future research may explore computational optimizations and broader applications across other functional data domains, potentially amplifying the utility and adaptability of these models in complex, real-world dataset scenarios.
