The proposed information transmission (TI) model for transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) notably advances computational prediction by explicitly incorporating position interdependencies among bases in binding motifs. Unlike traditional position weight matrix (PWM) methods that assume positional independence, this model leverages information theory principles to quantify the information transferred from TFBS to transcription factor (TF) upon binding, using TI as a criterion for TFBS recognition. The theoretical formalism and empirical results establish that including correlations between motif positions significantly enhances prediction accuracy and reduces false positives.

Empirical evaluation on Saccharomyces cerevisiae promoter regions demonstrates that the TI model successfully distinguishes real TFBSs, with most known sites exhibiting positive transferred information values. The parameter r, representing the length of considered r-base subsequences to capture dependencies, is pivotal. Transitioning from r = 1 (independent hypothesis) to r ≥ 2 yields a dramatic reduction in predicted sites and concomitant increase in predictive performance, consistent with theoretical expectations that pairwise and higher-order correlations are common in real motifs. An r value of 3 balances computational complexity and accuracy effectively, as further increases show diminishing returns.

Robustness analyses involving varying proportions of training data reveal that the TI model performs well even with limited prior knowledge, enabling identification of nearly half of TFBSs using only 25% known sites. This is critical for biological scenarios where training data is sparse. Visual scanning of genomic regions using the TI approach aligns well with experimentally mapped TFBS positions, further validating biological relevance.

Comparisons with established motif discovery tools, such as SOMBRERO, MEME, and AlignACE, indicate that the TI model outperforms or matches these methods, especially when sufficient training data is available. This superior performance underlines the advantage conferred by explicitly modeling positional dependencies and utilizing an information-theoretic binding criterion.

Testing on artificially generated sequences containing pseudo-motifs further underscores the model’s selectivity: pseudo-TFBSs derived from PWMs lacking positional correlations tend not to achieve TI thresholds required for binding prediction, leading to lower false positives. Conversely, when assuming independence (r = 1), the method identifies nearly all pseudo-sites but at the cost of high false positive rates, reaffirming that ignoring position interdependencies compromises specificity.

The model’s enhancement by using r-base correlations to estimate background probabilities and site information effectively addresses the limitations of the independent hypothesis that underlying PWM approaches suffer from. By capturing the nuanced positive and negative correlations among motif positions, the TI model more accurately estimates the actual information content of binding sites, avoiding over- or underestimation inherent in simplified additive models.

Notably, this work parallels efforts in structural and probabilistic modeling of TF-DNA interactions, such as the all-atom free energy models and homology-based PWM predictions reported by Morozov et al. Their findings highlight the importance of both direct protein-base contacts and DNA conformational flexibility in defining binding specificity, and similarly emphasize the significance of context-dependent, non-independent contributions to binding energies. These mechanistic insights are consistent with the information transmission framework, which does not rely solely on base frequencies but integrates dependencies that can arise from physical interactions and DNA shape.

While the structural models require high-resolution protein-DNA complex structures or close homologs, which limits their applicability, the TI model offers a data-driven, sequence-based approach that is broadly applicable and computationally efficient. Its theoretical underpinning grounded in information theory provides a rigorous biophysical rationale absent from purely machine learning or pattern recognition methods that lack biochemical interpretation.

Overall, the TI model constitutes a significant conceptual and practical advancement in TFBS prediction, successfully addressing key challenges such as degeneracy, positional dependencies, and false discovery inherent to traditional PWM methods. By incorporating position interdependencies through an information-theoretic metric of binding, the model not only improves predictive accuracy but also enhances the interpretability of binding specificity. Future integration of such models with comparative genomics and co-regulation data, as well as structural insights, could further refine transcriptional regulatory network inference, with broad implications for understanding gene regulation complexity.
