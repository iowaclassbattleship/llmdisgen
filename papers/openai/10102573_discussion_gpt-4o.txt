The current study successfully demonstrates the feasibility of using Glucose BioFuel Cells (GBFCs) based on carbon nanotube-matrix bioelectrodes for powering small electronic devices when implanted in a living rat. This approach represents a significant advancement in the development of sustainable implanted power systems, an area that has been pursuing alternatives to traditional battery-powered devices for decades.

The critical enhancement in this study was the application of carbon nanotube (CNT) matrices for the construction of bioelectrodes, which facilitates a significant improvement in the power output and stability of the GBFCs. Previous iterations of biofuel cells suffered from insufficient power output and low enzyme stability [Kerzenmacher et al., 2008], but the incorporation of CNTs has improved both the electron transfer efficiency and the stability of the bioelectrodes, allowing for higher open-circuit voltages and power densities that are closer to the requirements for biomedical devices.

One of the notable achievements of this study is the successful demonstration of GBFCs' capability to power practical electronic devices, such as a light-emitting diode and a digital thermometer, using the energy harvested from the rat's body. This shows promise for future applications in medical electronic devices that require intermittent power activation, such as sensors and diagnostic tools. The study demonstrates that energy management through capacitive storage can be achieved, which allows for stable power supply despite fluctuations in vehicle power output during operation. 

Furthermore, the study verifies the biocompatibility of the implanted GBFCs over a relatively long period (up to 17 days), which is vital for the long-term integration of such systems in living organisms. Encouragingly, the implanted devices demonstrated structural integrity and maintained functionality without adverse effects on the host, as exemplified by the weight stability and normal eating habits of the rats. However, the study notes the detachment of the electrical connection with the biofuel cell after some time, indicating that future designs may need improvements in connector durability and implantation techniques to extend the operational lifespan and reliability.

The implementation of CNTs is a step toward overcoming the limitations of previous abiotic and enzyme-based biofuel cells, which often faced challenges with enzyme catalyst deactivation due to environmental inhibitors, such as chloride ions and urate anions [Cracknell et al., 2008; Shin et al., 2007]. Despite these achievements, the currently reported power outputs, although promising, remain below the levels required for more demanding biomedical applications such as fully automated internal medical devices. Further developments are necessary to enhance enzyme performance, especially in vivo, where the physiological environment poses additional challenges.

Finally, while the results are promising, confirmation of long-term performance and the mechanisms of long-term enzyme stabilization are necessary. This study sets a foundational approach for future research focused on optimizing electrode materials and configurations to potentially meet higher power demands of medical devices and ensure biocompatibility and sustainability of implanted biofuel cells. The practical application of GBFCs in powering implantable medical devices marks an important milestone in the advancement of integrated bioelectronic devices, promising a future of sustained, biocompatible energy solutions directly harnessed from the host organism.
