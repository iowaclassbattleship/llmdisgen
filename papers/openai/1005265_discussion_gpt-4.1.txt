**Discussion**

This study demonstrates that combining QTL mapping data across rat and mouse crosses for HDL cholesterol can effectively narrow QTL confidence intervals and improve mapping precision, provided that the QTL are indeed homologous between species. This approach is conceptually similar to multi-cross or meta-analytic strategies previously described within a single species {{14076080}}, but extends the methodology across closely related genomes. By leveraging genome homology and standardizing marker positions, integration of datasets resulted in a marked reduction of candidate genomic intervals—halving the size of confidence intervals and nearly halving the number of contained genes in the two QTL analyzed, with commensurate increases in LOD scores.

Our results align with prior work on multi-cross QTL combination in single species (e.g., Li et al. {{14076080}}), which noted that combining crosses increased mapping power and precision, especially when the underlying genetic architecture is similar. In this context, combination across rat and mouse datasets, which share substantial genomic synteny and comparable genetic tools, resulted in improved statistical support (LOD) for the presence of QTL and, crucially, in narrowing the QTL intervals from 44 cM to 22 cM (mouse Chr 12–rat Chr 6) and from 41 cM to 19 cM (mouse Chr 11–rat Chr 10). The reduction of interval size by approximately 50% is on par with the gains reported by multi-population mapping within species {{14076080}}, confirming that the principle extends to inter-species analysis given careful curation of marker homology.

The degree of improvement observed here depends on certain critical assumptions and characteristics. First, the presence of high-sequence homology and conserved synteny in the QTL regions targeted is essential, given that misalignment or structural variation could lead to spurious combination or even loss of signal. Second, the concordance of trait definition and measurement across species underpins the validity of combining datasets: in this case, HDL cholesterol was measured using comparable assays and under similar environmental/dietary conditions. Third, the analysis depends on the underlying genetic variation being attributable to the same gene or regulatory element—an assumption supported but not guaranteed by coincident QTL peaks.

Consideration of sex as a covariate is also demonstrated as critical. The presence of sex-specific or sex-influenced QTL, particularly in lipid phenotypes, necessitated sex-stratified analysis; failing to do so could dilute or obfuscate QTL signals in one or both species and obscure the biological relationships.

The methodological framework, relying on standardized marker position mapping and Z-score phenotypic normalization, was necessary to make data structurally compatible across species. However, the approach is limited by several factors. First, the precision of interval narrowing is constrained by the density and accuracy of marker placement, which can be imperfect due to incomplete or ambiguous genome annotations, especially for older datasets. Second, the gains realized depend on the positive overlap between species and the amount of recombination in each mapping population—intervals will narrow only where recombination patterns are informative and shared across datasets.

In light of these results, several implications and opportunities for further research arise. Most immediately, the substantially narrowed QTL intervals translate into a more tractable set of candidate genes—reducing hundreds of candidates and focusing follow-up studies (e.g., functional screening, expression QTL analysis, or targeted genome editing). This efficiency is particularly valuable for complex traits such as lipid phenotypes, where the gene density in QTL intervals can otherwise preclude comprehensive follow-up. This inter-species combinatorial approach may also be applicable to other model species pairs with well-annotated genomes and conservation of phenotypes, substantially leveraging the collective power of historical data.

A further implication is that genomic and phenotypic data repositories should prioritize the archiving and harmonization of raw mapping data, as the success of this and similar approaches is predicated on the availability and compatibility of independent datasets {{14076080}}. Public sharing also facilitates independent replication, cross-validation, and meta-analysis, all of which strengthen genetic inference.

Some limitations persist. There is an inherent risk that inter-species differences in physiology, gene regulation, or environmental interactions could confound the mapping, even with homologous QTL. Also, while the combined analysis increases power and narrows intervals where QTL coincide, it cannot resolve underlying allelic heterogeneity—where the causative gene differs between species or between crosses, the approach may not substantially refine the region or may obscure genuine cross-specific effects.

In conclusion, this study shows that combined QTL mapping across rat and mouse can both strengthen statistical inference and expedite fine-mapping for conserved complex traits. The strategy is best understood as complementary to other advances, such as meta-analysis across mapping populations and integration of gene expression or sequence data. It provides a practical, scalable path for leveraging legacy data and comparative genomics, thereby accelerating progress toward the identification of causal genes underlying complex phenotypes.
