## Discussion

The present work develops and evaluates a wavelet-based approach to finite mixture regression models with functional predictors (WBFMR), including an adaptive variant (AWBFMR), for the analysis of scalar-on-function regression in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity. The motivating context is the limitation of standard functional linear models (FLMs) in scenarios where distinct subpopulations, each characterized by different coefficient functions, underlie the data. While previous methodologies have largely relied on functional principal component (FPC) representations of the predictors (e.g., [15606264], [12793573]), our method leverages the localizing capacity of the wavelet basis along with sparse estimation via L1-penalization, operationalized through a lasso-type framework.

**Comparison to FPC-based Methods**

The simulation studies delineate clear regimes in which the proposed WBFMR and AWBFMR methods outperform or align with FPC-based finite mixture regression (FMR) methods. For scenarios in which the true coefficient functions are smooth, FPC-based approaches benefit from the global basis structure, resulting in competitive or marginally better estimation and prediction accuracy, especially when predictor functions are well-sampled ([15606264]). However, as the underlying coefficient functions become more localized or "bumpy," the global nature of FPCs becomes a limitation—making it difficult to capture abrupt changes or local features—whereas wavelets, owing to their multiresolution and localizing properties, provide superior recovery and improved predictive performance. The wavelet basis’ ability to parsimoniously represent such functions is leveraged through penalized estimation, increasing estimation stability in high dimensions ([39181660], [42639], [52062868]).

**Role of Sparsity and Adaptive Penalization**

Both theoretical considerations and simulation results demonstrate the utility of L1-based penalties in finite mixture regression contexts, primarily when the dimension of the wavelet-transformed predictors is large relative to the sample size, or when many wavelet coefficients are truly zero ([52062868]). The simulations further indicate that, while the AWBFMR achieves enhanced sparsity (variable selection), the predictive and estimation improvement over the non-adaptive wavelet-based FMR is modest in the simulation settings considered. This modesty may stem from the synthetic data generation favoring relatively sparse underlying structures where both methods perform well, as also observed in [52062868] and [42639]. In less idealized or more complex empirical contexts, the benefits of adaptivity may be more pronounced, as noted in real-data applications of adaptive lasso ([52062868], [16162039]).

**Model Selection Procedures**

The performance of model selection criteria, specifically cross-validated predictive loss and modified BIC ([16239564]), converges in the simulations: both methods lead to similar models in terms of predictive performance. However, differences emerge in component selection. Cross-validation tends to overestimate the number of mixture components, an observation in line with established criticisms of cross-validation’s propensity for overfitting in finite mixture models ([52062868], [11031789]). In practical terms, this supports the use of modified BIC for component number selection, given its penalization for model complexity and alignment with theoretical optimality for mixture models.

**Application to DTI Data**

The analysis of DTI-associated corpus callosum profiles in MS patients exemplifies the utility of WBFMR in uncovering latent subpopulations with distinct relationships between tract structure and cognitive functioning. The identification of a subgroup with an identically zero coefficient function—implying no association between anisotropy and PASAT score—highlights the model’s ability to recover heterogeneous association structures, which may correspond to plausible biological or disease subtypes. This finding closely parallels biological heterogeneity observed in previous studies, e.g., distinct lifespans with different reproductive-longevity associations in fruit flies ([12793573]). Additionally, the improvement in predictive error relative to a one-component wavelet-based FLM further suggests that modeling unobserved heterogeneity via FMR can yield both interpretive and predictive gains.

**Theoretical and Algorithmic Considerations**

From a computational perspective, the adoption of penalized estimation in the EM algorithm for FMR enables stable and efficient inference even in high-dimensional settings, paralleling findings in the broader penalized regression and mixture model literature ([42639], [52062868]). The block-coordinate/generalized EM (GEM) approach, together with active set strategies, exhibits fast convergence and scalability, as previously demonstrated by [42639], [52062868]. Theoretical results from [52062868] provide assurances about oracle properties and convergence under L1-penalization in non-convex loss settings (such as mixtures).

Limitations remain, such as reliance on the correct specification of the number of mixture components (when BIC/CV fails), potential local optima in the EM algorithm, and the assumption of distinct, well-separated subpopulations. Extensions to functional responses, alternative penalties (e.g., nonconvex), or joint modeling of multiple functional predictors represent promising directions (see [7837016], [1927777]).

**Conclusion**

The wavelet-based and adaptive wavelet-based mixture regression models extend the functional regression toolkit to effectively handle heterogeneous functional covariate effects, especially in cases involving localized structure or high-dimensional functional predictors. They offer gains over existing principal component-based methods in relevant settings, are computationally practical, and are demonstrated to recover meaningful structure in both simulated and real neuroimaging data. Improvements in model selection, further adaptation to ultra-high-dimensional data, and theoretical guarantees under milder conditions merit additional research.
