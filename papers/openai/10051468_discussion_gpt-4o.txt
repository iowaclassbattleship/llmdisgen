The present study provides insights into the role of fibronectin in wound healing and microvascular endothelial cell activation. Using xenografts and species-specific anti-fibronectin antibodies, we demonstrated that fibronectin is synthesized in situ by blood vessels and not derived from plasma. This aligns with previous research indicating that cellular fibronectin, in contrast to plasma fibronectin, is crucial in the formation of the extracellular matrix and cellular functions (reference 13161383).

The increased presence of fibronectin in the walls of blood vessels near the wound site suggests its significant role in endothelial cell activation and proliferation. Autoradiography confirmed substantial endothelial cell proliferation at the wound edges, which is critical for wound healing and tissue repair. The specific detection of fibronectin in the vessel walls near wound sites, but not further away, highlights its potential role in localized cellular responses to injury.

Our findings corroborate other studies showing that fibronectin incorporation into the extracellular matrix occurs independently of its source, emphasizing the functional roles of cellular and plasma fibronectin (Yamada & Kennedy, 1979). The lack of cross-staining between anti-rat and anti-mouse fibronectin antibodies further validates these findings, confirming species-specific synthesis and incorporation in situ during the wound healing process.

Previous investigations into fibronectin's role in cell adhesion and matrix formation support our results that fibronectin within the cellular environment can promote the adhesion and spreading of cells, which are essential features for tissue regeneration (Engvall & Ruoslahti, 1977; Pearlstein, 1976). The observed endothelial cell activation and proliferation following injury, and the specific in situ production of fibronectin, may serve as therapeutic targets for enhancing wound healing and tissue repair processes.

These outcomes substantially contribute to the understanding of fibronectin's role in vascular biology and its dynamic response to injury, offering potential clinical implications for developing therapeutic interventions aimed at enhancing tissue repair and healing mechanisms.

Future studies could focus on characterizing the biochemical pathways leading to fibronectin synthesis in endothelial cells in situ and understanding the specific molecular interactions facilitating its matrix incorporation during endothelial proliferation in wounded tissues. Furthermore, investigating fibronectin's interaction with other extracellular matrix proteins in vivo could provide a more comprehensive view of its role in tissue repair and regeneration.
