**Discussion**

In this study, we established and characterized a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDX) model of high-risk neuroblastoma to more accurately recapitulate the molecular, histopathological, and therapeutic features of the human disease. Our results demonstrate that the orthotopic PDX retains the genomic, expression, and phenotypic characteristics of the primary patient tumor, develops loco-regional and distant metastases, and allows direct testing of conventional and molecularly targeted therapies in vivo.

A major limitation of traditional preclinical neuroblastoma models has been their reliance on established cell lines, which may undergo genetic drift and selection in vitro, ultimately deviating from the patient tumor’s original genomic landscape {{14511646}}. In contrast, our approach—guided by the MAST protocol—utilized freshly dissociated tumor from a high-risk patient, enabling establishment of a xenograft that faithfully retained key features of the primary disease, including MYCN amplification, 1p and 17q chromosomal aberrations, and expression of neuroendocrine markers. Genomic and epigenomic analyses further reinforced that the xenograft’s integrity was preserved across primary and metastatic sites, with high concordance in copy number, somatic SNVs, and DNA methylation profiles. Our findings mirror those of previous reports demonstrating that neuroblastoma PDXs maintain the genotype and phenotype of parental tumors {{18132057}} and support the use of PDXs as superior models for preclinical research compared to cell line-based systems.

A notable strength of this model is its ability to develop spontaneous distant metastases, including to the liver, a feature that is congruent with clinical behavior in high-risk neuroblastoma patients and previously reported for PDXs but rarely observed in subcutaneous or cell line xenografts {{18132057}}. The capacity to recapitulate the metastatic patterns observed in patients will be of particular relevance for preclinical evaluation of agents targeting minimal residual disease or metastatic spread.

In testing standard-of-care induction chemotherapy, we observed a heterogeneous therapeutic response within the PDX cohort, with a response rate that parallels clinical outcomes in patients with high-risk disease, further validating the translational relevance of our model. Importantly, we implemented a randomized, double-blind preclinical trial design and integrated data capture, providing a robust framework for future comparative preclinical studies.

Our study also highlights the activity of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway inhibition in this context. Consistent with prior reports {{11910305}}, combined inhibition of IGFR1 and PI3K/mTOR signaling significantly extended survival, reduced tumor vasculature (as measured by CD34 immunostaining), increased apoptosis, and altered cell cycle progression in the xenograft tumors. The observed reduction in angiogenesis and macrophage infiltration—features associated with tumor progression and immune evasion—suggests potential mechanisms by which targeted therapy may exert its anti-tumor effects. Nonetheless, differences in median survival across the two PI3K-targeted arms did not reach statistical significance, possibly reflecting the biological heterogeneity even within a single PDX model or limitations of sample size.

An additional technical advancement described here is the development of a high-throughput drug screening platform using dissociated PDX tumor cells. These primary cells exhibited lower sensitivity to chemotherapy than established neuroblastoma lines, underscoring the importance of utilizing primary tumor material for preclinical drug discovery and translational studies. The feasibility of high-throughput screening directly on PDX-derived cells provides a promising avenue for the identification and validation of novel therapeutics, including those overcoming chemotherapy resistance.

While our results establish a clinically relevant and molecularly faithful preclinical platform, several limitations should be acknowledged. Our PDX model was derived from a single patient tumor carrying MYCN amplification. As neuroblastoma is a genetically heterogeneous disease, future work must expand the repertoire of PDX models to encompass non-MYCN-amplified tumors and other representative subtypes, as similarly highlighted by previous efforts {{18132057}}. Additionally, the immunocompromised host environment may alter the tumor microenvironment compared to the human scenario and may not allow evaluation of immune-based therapies.

In conclusion, this patient-derived orthotopic xenograft model of high-risk neuroblastoma provides a robust tool for translational research, enabling faithful recapitulation of patient tumor biology, metastatic spread, and response to both standard and targeted therapy. The integration of systematic molecular characterization, clinically relevant imaging, and high-throughput drug screening establishes a foundation for bridging the gap between preclinical studies and clinical trials, and will be instrumental in accelerating the development of improved therapies for children with high-risk neuroblastoma. Future efforts should focus on expanding model diversity and leveraging PDX platforms to interrogate mechanisms of resistance, metastasis, and microenvironmental interactions in neuroblastoma.
