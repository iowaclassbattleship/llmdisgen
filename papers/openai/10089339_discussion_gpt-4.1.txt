**Discussion**

The results demonstrate that alignment-free, machine learning-based approaches provide significant advantages over traditional alignment/similarity-based methods for the identification of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), a highly diverse class of regulatory proteins. Alignment-based tools, such as those leveraging Pfam domains or similarity searches with PSI-BLAST, were shown to have limited sensitivity—highlighted by the observation that only a subset of bona fide CDKIs in the training set could be recognized by current Pfam domain profiles, and that PSI-BLAST failed to retrieve significant hits for a meaningful fraction of CDKI sequences. This is consistent with the recognized sequence variability in CDKI families across different taxa (e.g., INK4, Cip/Kip, Sic1, SIAMESE families) and the recognized limitations of similarity-based approaches for protein families with weak or non-canonical sequence conservation {{1246355}}, {{614128}}.

By contrast, support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models trained with composition-based and evolutionary features demonstrated much higher accuracy for CDKI prediction. Among the features tested, models based on position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) consistently outperformed those based on raw amino acid composition (AAC), dipeptide composition (DPC), split amino acid composition (SAAC), and gapped k-mer patterns for both SVMs and ANNs. The performance of PSSM-based SVM models reached overall accuracies of ~90% in leave-one-out cross-validation and outperformed PSI-BLAST in sensitivity and overall classification power. This supports prior findings that evolutionary profiles capture functionally relevant but non-obvious conservation patterns, enabling better discrimination of diverse protein families where sequence-based domain signatures may be absent or poorly defined {{614128}}.

DPC-based ANNs also exhibited relatively high accuracy and sensitivity, echoing conclusions from previous studies on cyclin and kinase prediction, where inclusion of composition-based features increased discriminatory power {{614128}}, {{3273679}}. However, for the present CDKI prediction problem, PSSM features provided the best threshold-independent performance as evidenced by ROC analysis (AUC = 0.933), further highlighting their value for complex protein classification.

Importantly, the selected PSSM-SVM model demonstrated low false positive rates when challenged with sequences of functionally related phosphatases and kinases—proteins that share some binding features with CDKIs—suggesting practical utility for genome-wide or large-scale functional annotation tasks. The assessment on independent “benchmark” and negative-control datasets mimicking practical application scenarios further validates the robustness and generalizability of the developed models, overcoming a common limitation of overfitting observed in some cross-validation procedures.

The deployment of the models as a user-friendly webserver opens up this resource to the wider research community and provides a practical platform for large-scale and combinatorial analyses in functional genomics and proteomics studies. The use of a flexible thresholding system allows users to adjust sensitivity/specificity trade-offs according to the context of their research.

Despite these advances, some limitations remain. As observed in related studies on cyclins and Cdk substrates {{3273679}}, prediction sensitivity is still not absolute—likely reflecting both the extreme diversity of CDKI families and the limitations of available training data. CDKI function is often mediated by short, context-specific motifs and by structural or disorder features not directly captured by sequence-based models. Inclusion of orthogonal information (e.g., predicted disorder, subcellular localization, or structural models) may further improve performance. Additionally, while the present models are tailored for general CDKI identification, subfamily-specific models could further enhance annotation specificity if and when larger, non-redundant datasets become available, mirroring approaches successfully employed in cyclin and kinase classification {{614128}}, {{3273679}}.

Future work could also involve the integration of multi-omics data (e.g., transcriptomics and phosphoproteomics) for contextual validation, or the use of transfer learning and deep learning models that may further improve classification accuracy given sufficiently large CDKI datasets.

In summary, these results illustrate that machine learning methods, particularly those informed by evolutionary profiles, substantially outperform similarity-based approaches for the recognition of highly divergent protein families such as CDKIs. The web implementation of these models addresses a pressing need for accurate, large-scale annotation of key cell cycle regulators and will facilitate advances in cancer research, drug discovery, and systems biology.
