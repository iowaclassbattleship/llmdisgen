The paper discusses various aspects of the Euclidean O(3) non-linear sigma model and its reduction using Pohlmeyer reduction. The solutions of the sigma model, including instanton, meron, and elliptic solutions, are explored in detail. Instanton solutions are found to have vanishing stress-energy tensor, while meron solutions have stress-energy tensor components related to the solution itself. Elliptic solutions interpolate between merons and instantons, with periodic and quasi-periodic solutions characterized by different energy levels.

In the reduced theory obtained through Pohlmeyer reduction, meron solutions are mapped to the ground state of the sinh-Gordon equation. The elliptic solutions in the reduced theory are classified into quasi-periodic solutions with positive energy levels and periodic solutions with negative energy levels. The stress-energy tensor components and the solutions in the reduced theory are derived for meron and elliptic solutions. It is emphasized that careful conformal transformations are needed to set the stress-energy tensor to a positive constant in the reduced theory.

The comparison between the initial sigma model solutions and the reduced theory solutions highlights the importance of selecting appropriate conformal transformations to maintain consistency in the mass scale. The relationship between the energy levels of periodic and quasi-periodic solutions in the original and reduced theories is discussed, showing that certain solutions in the reduced theory correspond to the same energy level despite being distinct in the original formulation. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the mapping between solutions of the Euclidean O(3) non-linear sigma model and the reduced theory obtained through Pohlmeyer reduction.
