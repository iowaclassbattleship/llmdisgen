The study presented in the abstract discusses the novel approach of combining QTL mapping data from different species to improve the statistical significance and narrow the confidence interval of QTL regions associated with High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. The method involves combining genotype data from rat and mouse crosses, followed by analysis using the EM algorithm and Bayesian analysis.

The key findings of the study include notable improvements in the LOD scores and reduction in the number of genes within the QTL confidence intervals when combining data from the rat and mouse crosses. Results from combining rat Chromosome 6 data with mouse Chromosome 12 data showed an increase in LOD scores and a reduction in the confidence interval size. Similar improvements were observed when combining rat Chromosome 10 data with mouse Chromosome 11 data, indicating the efficacy of this multi-species QTL analysis approach.

The study establishes a methodological framework for combining QTL mapping results from different species, providing a simple yet effective way to enhance the precision and significance of QTL localization. By incorporating physical positions and locus-specific P-values, the approach not only improves the accuracy of QTL mapping but also facilitates fine mapping and integration of data from diverse mapping studies.

Overall, the findings suggest that combining data from different species can be a robust strategy for refining QTL mapping results, ultimately aiding in the identification of candidate genes associated with complex traits such as HDL cholesterol levels. The approach outlined in the study offers a valuable tool for researchers conducting genetic mapping studies across multiple species to enhance the understanding of the genetic basis of various phenotypic traits.
