The present study demonstrates that combining QTL mapping data across species—specifically between rat and mouse crosses—can effectively enhance the statistical power and resolution of QTL localization for a complex trait such as HDL cholesterol levels. This approach extends previous efforts that combined QTL data within a single species (e.g., within multiple mouse crosses) and leverages the considerable homology and synteny between the rat and mouse genomes to identify overlapping QTL regions likely attributable to shared underlying genetic loci.

Our results show that integrating rat and mouse QTL datasets for homologous chromosomal segments resulted in notable increases in LOD scores and appreciable reductions in confidence interval widths. For example, combining data from rat chromosome 6 and mouse chromosome 12 roughly doubled the LOD score and halved the QTL confidence interval, reducing the number of candidate genes by approximately 50%. Similarly, combining rat chromosome 10 and mouse chromosome 11 data produced an increase in LOD score and nearly a 50% reduction in interval length and candidate gene number. This concordance and improvement corroborate the underlying assumption that the same gene or closely linked genes influence HDL cholesterol variation in both species.

These findings are consistent with prior observations of cross-species QTL concordance for lipid traits and support the broader concept that evolutionary conserved genomic regions harbor functionally analogous QTL. By assigning precise homologous genomic coordinates through LiftOver and Ensembl Comparative Genomics tools, we were able to align rat markers to the mouse genome with high fidelity, allowing for the direct combination of datasets despite the species difference. This cross-species integration complements existing meta-analytic frameworks that rely on combining LOD values or p-values but do not necessarily incorporate positional homology to refine intervals.

In terms of methodological considerations, the necessity to separate datasets by sex was critical given the presence of sex-specific QTL in the rat and mouse crosses. This stratification minimized confounding effects and ensured that QTL combined across species reflected true genetic effects rather than sex-biased linkage. Using a consistent allele coding system for high and low allele strains across species further ensured comparability in the combined analyses.

The approach offers an efficient strategy to reduce the number of putative functional candidates within broad QTL intervals, thus facilitating downstream experimental validation such as fine mapping, candidate gene sequencing, or functional assays. Given the typical expansiveness of QTL confidence intervals found in single cross analyses and the laborious nature of subsequent narrowing steps, cross-species combination can save considerable time and resources. Importantly, the reduction in candidate gene numbers observed here—from hundreds or over a thousand genes to an approximately halved number—underscores the practical utility of this approach.

Despite its promise, certain limitations merit consideration. First, successful combination depends on the availability of sufficiently overlapping and homologous QTL intervals across species, which may not be present for all traits or genomic regions. Additionally, differences in genetic architecture—such as species-specific modifier loci, allelic heterogeneity, or epistatic interactions—could limit the applicability of this method or necessitate modeling of interaction terms, although in our analyses interaction effects were not significant. Finally, while rat-to-mouse genome alignment is reliable given their close evolutionary relationship, extending this approach to more distantly related species may be hindered by lower synteny and more complex genomic rearrangements.

In conclusion, our findings establish the feasibility and utility of multi-species QTL data combination as a fine-mapping strategy, complementing within-species data aggregation and other meta-analytic techniques. This strategy can be particularly valuable for phenotypes with well-conserved genetic determinants between related species and may accelerate the identification of causal genes underlying complex traits by refining QTL localization and reducing candidate gene lists. Future applications should explore incorporating additional species or related phenotypes, as well as integrating other genomic and functional data layers, to further enhance QTL resolution and biological insight.
