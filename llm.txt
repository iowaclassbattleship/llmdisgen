Cervical cancer continues to represent a significant public health challenge, particularly in developing countries. The finding that it is the second most common cancer among women globally, and the most common among Indian women, underscores the substantial burden this disease imposes [1]. The absence of organized screening programs in many low- and middle-income countries contributes to delayed diagnosis, with a majority of patients presenting at tertiary care centers in advanced stages. This pattern is consistent with previous reports highlighting late-stage presentation as a key factor in poor outcomes [2,3].

The high prevalence of locally advanced disease at diagnosis not only complicates treatment but also limits the potential for successful intervention, emphasizing the critical importance of early detection. Implementation of population-based screening strategies, such as cytology or HPV DNA testing, could substantially reduce incidence and mortality rates. In addition, education campaigns targeting awareness of cervical cancer symptoms and risk factors may facilitate earlier presentation and improve outcomes.

However, addressing these challenges is not straightforward. Resource limitations, cultural barriers, and infrastructural constraints pose significant obstacles to the widespread adoption of organized screening programs. Future research should focus on cost-effective, scalable screening models tailored to resource-constrained settings. Moreover, evaluating the effectiveness of vaccination programs against high-risk HPV strains could provide complementary strategies for long-term prevention.

In conclusion, the persistent burden of cervical cancer in developing countries highlights an urgent need for integrated approaches combining early detection, public health education, and preventive interventions. Efforts to strengthen health systems and implement context-specific screening initiatives are likely to have a profound impact on reducing morbidity and mortality from this preventable disease.
