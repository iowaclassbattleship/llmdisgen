              "It is increasingly being recognised that the quantitative evaluation of biomedical research cannot depend only on the counting of citations in the serial literature. They may measure academic influence, but the funders of such research are usually more concerned to see if it has had a practical benefit, especially to patients. One of the ways in which research can influence practice is through its contribution to the evidence base supporting clinical guidelines {{12990900}}{{not_in_s2orc}}{{not_in_s2orc}}{{4992451}}{{42067051}}. These are increasingly being used across many countries in the routine clinical care of cancer patients. Most of them are published by national professional medical associations (e.g., {{6130785}}{{45033792}}{{30394593}}, but some are developed by governmental bodies (e.g., {{20079372}}.",
              "It is normal for such guidelines to have lists of references that comprise their evidence base. However, the quality of the evidence is sometimes doubtful {{3065283}}{{19332737}}{{21492156}}, and schemes have been devised to grade the quality of the clinical trials, which form a large part of the evidence base (e.g., {{22091521}}{{39213437}}{{not_in_s2orc}}{{8284450}}{{22721728}}. Even when the guidelines have been published, they are sometimes criticised as inadequate {{not_in_s2orc}}{{not_in_s2orc}}{{40677359}}, insufficient {{38413898}} or they may become outdated {{23806012}}. There is also the question of whether the guidelines will actually be followed in clinical practice {{42615096}}{{9589309}}{{25848593}}{{1814188}}. The breadth of oncology practice (both patients and treatment modalities), the rapid evolution of new treatments and the often diverse interpretation of 'evidence' by health-care professionals mean many patients are treated with hospitalspecific protocols rather than national guidelines. This situation is particularly acute in certain site-specific cancers, for example, lung {{15135204}}.",
              "A further cause of disagreement is the question of cost: a new drug may be clinically effective and better than existing drugs or a placebo, but so costly that an equivalent or greater health gain may be achievable by other means, for example, better screening to detect the disease at an early stage. This can cause considerable dissension and lead to lawsuits to make the drug available for particularly articulate patients {{39207487}}, or from companies and patients' advocacy groups, which sometimes receive their subsidies {{26204397}}. Lobbying of the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) by pharmaceutical firms is now rife {{27084170}}, and a US politician has adopted bully-boy tactics in his efforts to subvert evidence-based medicine {{72875227}}. The cost basis of NICE's recommendations has also been criticised: the figure of d30 000 (h40 000, $60 000) per quality-adjusted life year appears not to have a scientific basis or to take account of the social costs of disease {{47554094}}.",
              "Despite all these criticisms, clinical guidelines are nevertheless gaining increasing recognition as the way forward. It does, therefore, seem worthwhile to treat them as an outcome indicator, even though a partial one, of the clinical impact of the research they cite. Several studies have analysed the evidence base of selected clinical guidelines {{154559501}}{{10747489}}{{not_in_s2orc}}. They have established that the papers cited are very clinical (when positioned on a scale from clinical observation to basic research); that the UK guidelines overcite the UK research papers; and that the cited papers are quite recent, with a temporal distribution comparable to that of the papers cited on biomedical research papers. Research from other European countries seems to be cited about as much as would be expected on the UK clinical guidelines, but that from Japan and from most developing countries is almost totally ignored.",
              "In this study, we examined three sets of the UK guidelines on a single subject, cancer, and the references on 43 different guidelines, almost all concerned with treatment rather than with prevention. The bibliographic details of the references were assembled in a file and compared with those of cancer research publications in the three peak years {{not_in_s2orc}}. The objective was to answer several policy-related questions:",
              "how do countries' relative presences among the cited references compare with their presences in cancer research? how many of the cited references are actually classifiable as cancer research? what is the research level (RL) distribution of these cited references compared with that of cancer research papers? are the cited references published in journals of high citation impact? how does the funding of the cited papers compare with that of cancer research overall?",
              "The latter two questions need to take account of the finding that the references on clinical guidelines are much more clinical than other biomedical research."

This takes the form of a book that is revised and extended every 6 months, but is also accessible on the Web (to people in the United Kingdom); Developed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) for the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales, based on Health Technology Assessments (HTAs). Most of these last are available on the Web, but not all (although it is intended by NICE that they should be). They were used in the present study, because the references on the actual guidelines were usually not visible; Developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) for use by the NHS in Scotland. All these are freely available on the Web Only a minority of these guidelines and HTAs are applicable to cancer. The numbers are, respectively, 15, 18 and 10. Each of these 43 documents has a set of references, most of which are articles in peer-reviewed journals. A total of 3217 references were found and their details downloaded to file. Their addresses were parsed by means of a special macro so that the integer and fractional counts of each country were listed for each paper (a paper with two addresses in the United Kingdom and one in France would count unity for each on an integer count basis, but 0.67 for the United Kingdom and 0.33 for France using fractional counting). The RL of each paper was determined using the new system developed by {{7942963}}, in which each journal is assigned an RL based on the presence of 'clinical' and 'basic' words in the titles of papers it has published on a scale from 1 \u00bc clinical to 4 \u00bc basic. In addition, the RL of groups of individual cited papers could be calculated with reference to their individual titles, and the presence of 'clinical' or 'basic' words within them. The potential citation impact (PCI) of each cited paper was also determined with reference to a file of Journal Expected Citation Rates provided by Thomson Scientific (London, UK). This gave the mean number of citations for papers published in a journal in a given year and cited in the year of publication and the 4 subsequent years.",
              "Funding data for virtually all the UK papers (790 out of 796) were obtained from inspection of the acknowledgements to their funding sources in the British Library. Many of the papers had previously been looked up for the Research Outputs Database {{not_in_s2orc}} or for other projects, and only 151 needed to be sought anew. The main comparator used to normalise the results of the analysis of the cited references was a file of world oncology research papers {{27557788}}. For the years 1999 -2001, there were over 100 000 such papers, and their characteristics were used to see how the cited references compared with them, with due account being taken of the differences expected in mean RLs (the cited references being more clinical than oncology papers overall). Of the references classed as 'articles' or 'reviews', 88% were within the subfield of oncology as defined by Cancer Research UK {{27557788}}. This percentage remained sensibly constant over the period, 1994 -2004. However, the references were in much more clinical journals than world oncology papers for the year 2000, the peak year for the numbers of references, see Figure 2. This result was obtained earlier {{10747489}}{{not_in_s2orc}} but with a much simplified (and less accurate) method of categorisation of journals by RL. Of the 3217 papers, 2747 titles (86%) had either a 'clinical' or a 'basic' keyword, and the mean RL was 1.07, which is very close to the lower end of the scale (RL \u00bc 1.0), and much below the mean RL based on all the papers in the individual journals (RL \u00bc 1.43). This shows that the references were being published in journals that were relatively more basic than the papers themselves, and reinforces the message that the papers were, therefore, almost entirely clinical observation."

Figure 3 presents the ratio between a country's presence in the guideline references and its presence in oncology research, that is, the values shown in the last column of Table 1. As would be expected, the UK oncology research is cited more than expected from its presence in world oncology by a factor of almost 3, but several other European countries' work is also relatively overcited, notably that of Denmark, Ireland and Sweden. Although Italy, which is strong in clinical trials, shows to advantage, Germany is relatively much undercited compared with its presence in cancer research in recent years. Japanese work is almost ignored, but it is likely that the Science Citation Index, where most of the references were found, does not cover Japanese clinical journals. This, however, is only a small part of the reason for the paucity of Japanese references.",
              "Within the United Kingdom, certain cities showed relatively to advantage in terms of their percentage presence within the fractional UK total of 605 papers cited by the guidelines, compared with that in the 2332 UK oncology papers published in 2000. The analysis is conveniently carried out on the basis of postcode area, the first one or two letters of the UK postcode system, for example, B \u00bc Birmingham, CB \u00bc Cambridge. Figure 4 shows a scatter plot for the 26 leading areas (out of 124), accounting for about two-thirds of both totals. The spots above the diagonal line represent areas that are more frequently cited than expected, and vice versa. Among the former, EH \u00bc Edinburgh and G \u00bc Glasgow are prominent, in part because the SIGN guidelines overcite Scottish research papers, together with SM \u00bc Sutton and Cheam (the location of the Institute of Cancer Research) and OX \u00bc Oxford.",

For nearly all the countries, there are close similarities between the time trends, which suggest that the guidelines are rather consistent in the geography of their citing behaviour. Thus, Australia, Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom  Figure 3.  Table 1. and the United States have all shown a reducing presence in oncology research, and a reducing presence in the guideline references; Germany, on the other hand, has increased its presence in both (but is still much undercited). France and Japan increased their presence in both sets of papers, but it went down slightly during the latest period."

For the purposes of this analysis, funding sources were grouped into five main sectors:",

A subset of this sector is Cancer Research UK, and its two predecessors, the Cancer Research Campaign and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund; pharmaceutical industry, both domestic and foreign (it is often difficult to distinguish as some subsidiaries have considerable autonomy in the use of research funds), and including biotech companies; nonpharma industry; no funding acknowledged.",
              "The remaining funding organisations are foreign governmental and private nonprofit sources, and international organisations,    {{not_in_s2orc}}   Impact of cancer research G Lewison and R Sullivan such as the European Commission (EC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The funding sources vary with the RL of the papers: the more clinical papers have fewer sources and the more basic papers have more. Table 4 shows the analysis for the UK papers in oncology in {{not_in_s2orc}} Table 5 shows the results for the UK papers cited on cancer clinical guidelines. For each RL group, an estimate has been made of the funding that would have been expected had they been typical of the UK cancer research, and in the last row there are given the ratios of observed-to-expected numbers of papers (integer counts) on the assumption that the cancer clinical guideline citations are typical of oncology, but with due allowance for the different RL distributions.",
              "For example, the UK oncology papers in the first group (RL from 1.0 to 1.5) have the UK government funding on 11.1% of them, so it might be expected that there would be 0.111 \u00c2 544 \u00bc 60.4 government-funded papers among the corre-sponding group cited on cancer clinical guidelines. In fact, there were 149 such papers, showing that many more are government funded than might have been expected. When the totals for each of the six groups are added, it can be seen that the observed number of the UK government-funded papers is almost twice the predicted number. The observed total is still higher ( \u00c2 2.5) for the pharma industry-funded papers, and a little lower for Cancer Research UK papers ( \u00c2 1.8), for nonpharma industry papers ( \u00c2 1.6) and the UK private nonprofit papers ( \u00c2 1.3). Not surprisingly, there are many fewer 'unfunded' papers, the ratio of observed-to-expected numbers of papers being only just over half."

            "The UK cancer clinical guidelines are sufficient in number and variety to provide a fair window on the impact of cancer research on clinical practice, not only in the United Kingdom, but in other leading countries, particularly in western Europe. We have seen that almost all the references (88%) are to papers that are within the subfield of cancer research. Because about one-third of the research supported by Cancer Research UK, in common with that of other medical research charities working in a particular disease area, is out with this subfield (most of this would comprise basic biology), it follows that little of this work can be expected to influence clinical guidelines -hardly a surprising conclusion, but nevertheless one that is worth stating.",
            "Many of the guideline references are to papers in the US and the UK general medical journals -The Journal of the American Medical Association, New England Journal Medical, British Medical Journal and The Lancet. This is one reason, but by no means the only one, for the guideline references as a whole to be in high impact, and therefore well known, journals. It appears that if researchers want their work, particularly clinical trials, to be part of the evidence base for clinical guidelines, then it is desirable for them to publish in highly cited journals. Disproportionately, many of these papers will have been funded by government or the pharmaceutical industry, with charities also playing an enhanced role compared with cancer research overall. This highlights one pitfall of national guidelines in the context of research impact assessments; many important, high quality clinical trials -either because they are early phase or negative -will not make it into guidelines. The impact of research on national clinical guidelines is just one parameter that can describe the utility of health research {{9662045}} Table 4."

            "When account is taken of the clinical nature of the work cited on guidelines, the big increase in the percentage of the papers that acknowledge funding -whether from government, charities or industry -is striking (Table 5). Many (37%) of these clinical papers with RLs greater than 1.5 are reports of clinical trials, and 85% of the latter acknowledge funding compared with 71% of the others. Cancer Research UK plays the biggest role, and supports over one-third of these trials, more even than the pharmaceutical industry as a whole, or the UK government.",
            "The geographical analysis of the cited papers reveals that the UK papers have a threefold higher presence among them than in world cancer research. In part, this reflects the differences in cancer management between countries. Such overcitation also occurs on other scientific papers, so it is hardly surprising that it was found here. It might be expected that the UK guidelines, which aim to show which treatments are cost-effective, would reflect in particular the different financial basis of health-care provision in this country compared with that elsewhere, and so papers concerned with economics and costs would be even more overcited if they were from the United Kingdom. In fact, this does occur, but to a very minor extent (22% from the United Kingdom compared with 19% overall; the difference not being significant).",
            "The distribution of the cited papers within the United Kingdom differs from what might have been expected based purely on overall numbers and on the extent to which the cities carry out clinical observation rather than basic research. The simple comparison of Figure 4 needs also to take account of the mean RL of papers from each area, and, when this is done ( Figure 5), a different pattern emerges, with EH \u00bc Edinburgh, OX \u00bc Oxford and CB \u00bc Cambridge forming an axis of excellence (on this indicator) and other areas' output being less cited on guidelines. The distance of the spots from this axis gives one indicator of the performance of the different centres, an imperfect one to be sure, as there will be other confounding factors not considered here, but nevertheless a useful complement to the traditional bibliometric criterion based purely on citation counts in the scientific literature.",
            "There are in the database enough cited papers from a few other countries to enable a similar evaluation to be carried out for them. However, these data are inevitably skewed by being viewed through the prism of the UK clinical recommendations. It would be highly desirable to complement them with the results of similar exercises carried out in other countries with extensive sets of clinical guidelines, or at a European or international level. Then, provided the data were collected in exactly the same way, they could be pooled and a more international perspective on the utility of cancer research would emerge that research evaluators could employ. Such an activity could appropriately be coordinated by the European Cancer Managers' Research Forum, with all data contributors having also the right to gain access to the data provided by workers in other countries."

                "The analysis demonstrates a significant and disproportionate influence of UK-produced oncology research on national clinical guidelines and Health Technology Assessments, as evidenced by citation patterns. The finding that UK papers were cited nearly three times more frequently than their global publication volume (6.5%) would predict indicates a strong alignment between domestic research priorities and the evidence needs of UK guideline developers. This \"home advantage\" likely reflects several factors: the direct relevance of UK-based clinical trials and observational studies to the national healthcare context (e.g., patient demographics, healthcare systems, and approved treatments), greater accessibility of this research to guideline committees, and potentially shared research agendas between funders, researchers, and policy bodies.",
                "The pronounced contributions from specific centres, notably Edinburgh and Glasgow, highlight that research impact is not uniformly distributed. This clustering suggests that certain institutions have successfully cultivated research programmes that are particularly translational or directly address gaps in clinical evidence deemed critical for guideline formulation. Their success may stem from strategic focus areas, established networks with clinical practice, or methodologies that robustly answer questions central to health technology assessment.",
                "A critical finding is the higher prevalence of explicitly acknowledged funding in UK papers cited by guidelines compared to the broader corpus of UK oncology research. This implies that research with transparent funding sources\u2014from charitable, governmental, and commercial sectors\u2014is more likely to meet the high evidence standards required for guideline development. Explicit funding acknowledgements may correlate with larger, more robust study designs (e.g., randomised controlled trials, comprehensive systematic reviews) that are prioritised in evidence hierarchies. Consequently, funding transparency may serve as an indirect marker of research quality and methodological rigour from a guideline developer's perspective.",
                "In conclusion, the UK's oncology guideline evidence base is disproportionately and strategically domestic, driven by a subset of high-impact institutions and characterised by research with clearly documented funding. This underscores the importance of national research investment and strategic funding alignment to generate the specific, high-calibre evidence required to directly inform and improve clinical practice standards. Future assessments should investigate whether this pattern leads to more effective and implementable guidelines, or if an over-reliance on domestically skewed evidence might inadvertently limit the incorporation of pivotal global research findings."

This can be studied by a number of methods, but its influence on clinical guidelines must rank as one of the most important. In cancer, there are 43 UK guidelines (and associated Health Technology Assessments) published (up to October 2006) across three series, each of which has an evidence base in the form of references, many of which are papers in peer-reviewed journals. These have all been identified and analysed to determine their geographical provenance and type of research, in comparison with overall oncology research published in the peak years of guideline references (1999\u20132001). The UK papers were cited nearly three times as frequently as would have been expected from their presence in world oncology research (6.5%). Within the United Kingdom, Edinburgh and Glasgow stood out for their unexpectedly high contributions to the guidelines' scientific base. The cited papers from the United Kingdom acknowledged much more explicit funding from all sectors than did the UK cancer research papers at the same research level.

Instanton solutions in this class of models can be understood as being composed by two merons. These have been studied especially in the context of the relation of two-dimensional sigma models to four-dimensional Yang-Mills theories {{121804459}}, (for a review on the subject see {{123579404}} and the references therein), which are also characterized by such solutions which dominate the path integral at strong coupling providing a qualitative picture for the confined phase of these theories {{10443315}}.",
              "Elliptic solutions that interpolate between instanton and meron solutions have also been discovered {{not_in_s2orc}}. These solutions can be understood as the intermediate stages of the dissociation of meron pairs, supporting the relation between meron pairs and instantons.",

The critical element of this approach is a non-local coordinate transformation that manifestly satisfies the Virasoro constraints, thus leaving only the physical degrees of freedom. In the case of the O (3) model, this method leads to the relation of the sigma model to the sine-Gordon equation {{123165375}}, while for higher dimensional symmetric spaces one results in multi-component generalizations of the latter.",
              "Whether the reduced theory can be obtained from a local action is a non-trivial question in this approach, since the degrees of freedom of the reduced theory are connected to the original ones in a non-local way. It turns out that the reduced theory can be considered as a gauged WZW model with an integrable potential in a specific gauge {{119380056}}{{18830993}}{{18368480}}, allowing a systematic method to find the Lagrangian of the reduced theory.",
              "The reduced theory has an integrable structure, allowing the construction of interesting solitonic solutions. However, the construction of the corresponding solution in the original sigma model is non-trivial due to the non-trivial relation between the original and reduced degrees of freedom. Such constructions have been of particular interest in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence in which case the non-linear sigma model describes the dynamics of strings propagating in AdS spaces {{2450039}}{{118514287}}{{2284875}}{{16004701}}{{not_in_s2orc}}.",
              "Since several aspects of the relation between the sigma model and the reduced integrable theory have not been understood yet, mapping the solutions of the reduced theories to instanton, meron and elliptic solutions or the original sigma model may provide interesting insights to the properties of Pohlmeyer reduction.",
              "The structure of this paper is as following: In section 2 we review basic facts of the O (3) non-linear sigma model. In section 3 we review the instanton, meron and elliptic solutions of the model. In section 4 we study the Pohlmeyer reduction of the Euclidean O (3) model resulting in the sinh-Gordon equation. In section 5, we study the mapping between the solutions of the sigma model in the original formulation, as reviewed in section 2, and solutions of the sinh-Gordon equation. Finally, in section 6 we discuss our results. There is also en appendix with properties of Jacobi elliptic functions that are used throughout the text."

Instantons are topologically non-trivial, finite-action solutions that satisfy first-order (self-duality) equations. Their failure to map to a solution in the reduced theory indicates that the Pohlmeyer reduction procedure, which inherently links the NLSM field to the reduced field through derivatives, projects out these configurations. This is consistent with the understanding that the reduction process effectively isolates the dynamic, non-topological degrees of freedom. The topological charge, a key characteristic of instantons, is not captured by the local, differential relations defining the reduction, explaining their disappearance in the sinh-Gordon description.",
                "In contrast, the mapping of meron configurations to the ground state (the trivial, constant vacuum solution) of the sinh-Gordon equation is analytically consistent. Merons are singular, infinite-action solutions with a fractional topological charge. Their identification with the vacuum of the reduced theory underscores their role as degenerate or singular limits within the NLSM, which correspond to the absence of excitation in the integrable system framework. This result reinforces the interpretation of merons as pathological rather than dynamic configurations from the perspective of the reduced integrable flow.",

These regular, finite-action solutions interpolate continuously between instanton and meron limits. The two-fold degeneracy in the mapping indicates that distinct NLSM configurations, presumably related by a discrete symmetry (such as an inversion in the field space or a shift in the spectral parameter of the associated Lax pair), collapse onto the same solution of the sinh-Gordon equation. This highlights that the Pohlmeyer reduction is not an isomorphism but a homomorphism that quotients out this discrete symmetry. The elliptic solutions thus represent the genuine dynamical excitations shared by both descriptions, with their integrability parameters (e.g., the modulus of the elliptic functions) directly governing the properties of the corresponding sinh-Gordon solution.",

This elucidates which aspects of the O(3) NLSM's solution space are encoded in the sine/sinh-Gordon integrable hierarchy and underscores that the reduced theory describes specifically the non-topological, propagating degrees of freedom."

It has been shown that instantons, which are solutions that do not have a direct counterpart in the sigma model, do not have a counterpart in the sine-Gordon equation. This is due to the fact that the sine-Gordon equation is a second-order differential equation, while instantons are one-dimensional.",
                "Similarly, the ground state of the O(3) non-linear sigma model corresponds to the solutions that interpolate between merons, which are solutions that do have a direct correspondence in the sigma model. This is because the O(3) non-linear sigma model can be reduced to a two-dimensional system, which can be expressed in terms of the"

                "Write the discussion based on the following scientific excerpt: It is well known that sigma models in symmetric spaces accept equivalent descriptions in terms of integrable systems, such as the sine\u2010Gordon equation, through Pohlmeyer reduction. In this paper, we study the mapping between known solutions of the Euclidean O(3) non\u2010linear sigma model, such as instantons, merons and elliptic solutions that interpolate between the latter, and solutions of the Pohlmeyer reduced theory, namely the sinh\u2010Gordon equation. It turns out that instantons do not have a counterpart, merons correspond to the ground state, while the class of elliptic solutions is characterized by a two to one correspondence between solutions in the two descriptions. [/INST] [/INST] The abstract discusses the relationship between solutions in the Euclidean O(3) non-linear sigma model and the Pohlmeyer reduced theory, specifically the sinh-Gordon equation. The authors find that instantons, which are solutions of the Euclidean O(3) sigma model, do not have a counterpart in the Pohlmeyer reduced theory. Merons, on the other hand, correspond to the ground state solutions in the Pohlmeyer reduced theory. The class of elliptic solutions in the Euclidean O(3) sigma model is found to have a two-to-one correspondence with solutions in the Pohlmeyer reduced theory. Instantons and merons are well-known solutions in the Euclidean O(3) sigma model, while elliptic solutions interpolate between them. The authors provide a mapping between these solutions in both theories, adding to the understanding of the equivalence between sigma models in symmetric spaces and integrable systems."
