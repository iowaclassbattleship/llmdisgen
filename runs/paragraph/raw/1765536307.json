              "Recent research has shown substantial improvements can be achieved by utilizing consensus statistics obtained from outputs of multiple machine translation systems. Translation consensus can be measured either at sentence level or at word level. For example, Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) {{11706155}} decoding over n-best list tries to find a hypothesis with lowest expected loss with respect to all the other translations, which can be viewed as sentence-level consensus-based decoding. Word based methods proposed range from straightforward consensus voting {{60593850}}{{15034416}} to more complicated word-based system combination model {{14570741}}{{7061405}}. Typically, the resulting systems take outputs of individual machine translation systems as input, and build a new confusion network for second-pass decoding.",
              "There have been many efforts dedicated to advance the state-of-the-art performance by combining multiple systems' outputs. Most of the work focused on seeking better word alignment for consensus-based confusion network decoding {{15034416}} or word-level system combination {{not_in_s2orc}}{{2305418}}. In addition to better alignment, {{1101652}} introduced an incremental strategy for confusion network construction; and Hildebrand and Vogel (2008) proposed a hypotheses reranking model for multiple systems' outputs with more features including word translation probability and n-gram agreement statistics.",
              "A common property of all the work mentioned above is that the combination models work on the basis of n-best translation lists (full hypotheses) of existing machine translation systems. However, the n-best list only presents a very small portion of the entire search space of a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) model while a majority of the space, within which there are many potentially good translations, is pruned away in decoding. In fact, due to the limitations of present-day computational resources, a considerable number of promising possibilities have to be abandoned at the early stage of the decoding process. It is therefore expected that exploring additional possibilities beyond n-best hypotheses lists for full sentences could bring improvements to consensus-based decoding.",
              "In this paper, we present collaborative decoding (or co-decoding), a new SMT decoding scheme to leverage consensus information between multiple machine translation systems. In this scheme, instead of using a post-processing step, multiple machine translation decoders collaborate during the decoding process, and translation consensus statistics are taken into account to improve ranking not only for full translations, but also for partial hypotheses. In this way, we expect to reduce search errors caused by partial hypotheses pruning, maximize the contribution of translation consensus, and result in better final translations.",
              "We will discuss the general co-decoding model, requirements for decoders that enable collaborative decoding and describe the updated model structures. We will present experimental results on the data sets of NIST Chinese-to-English machine translation task, and demonstrate that co-decoding can bring significant improvements to baseline systems. We also conduct extensive investigations when different settings of codecoding are applied, and make comparisons with related methods such as word-level system combination of hypothesis selection from multiple n-best lists.",
              "The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives a formal description of the codecoding model, the strategy to apply consensus information and hypotheses ranking in decoding. In Section 3, we make detailed comparison between co-decoding and related work such as system combination and hypotheses selection out of multiple systems. Experimental results and discussions are presented in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper."

              "1. Co-decoding model. A co-decoding model consists of a set of member models, which are a set of augmented baseline models. We call decoders based on member models member decoders, and those based on baseline models baseline decoders. In our work, any Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) SMT model with log-linear formulation {{284436}} can be a qualified candidate for a baseline model. The requirement for a loglinear model aims to provide a natural way to integrate the new co-decoding features.",

A baseline model can be viewed as a special case of member model with all codecoding feature values set to 0. Accordingly, a baseline decoder can be viewed as a special setting of a member decoder.",
              "3. Decoder coordinating. In co-decoding, each member decoder cannot proceed solely based on its own agenda. To share consensus statistics with others, the decoding must be performed in a coordinated way.",

Note that in Equation 2, though the baseline score function \u03a6 , can be computed inside each decoder, the case of \u03a8 ( , \u210b ( )) is more complicated. Because usually it is not feasible to enumerate the entire hypothesis space for machine translation, we approximate \u210b with n-best hypotheses by convention. Then there is a circular dependency between co-decoding features and \u210b ( ) : on one hand, searching for n-best approximation of \u210b ( ) requires using Equation 2 to select topranked hypotheses; while on the other hand, Equation 2 cannot be computed until every \u210b ( ) is available.",
              "We address this issue by employing a bootstrapping method, in which the key idea is that we can use baseline models' n-best hypotheses as seeds, and iteratively refine member models' n-best hypotheses with co-decoding. Similar to a typical phrase-based decoder , we associate each hypothesis with a coverage vector c to track translated source words in it. We will use \u210b ( , ) for the set of hypotheses associated with c, and we also denote with \u210b ( ) = \u210b ( , ) the set of all hypotheses generated by member decoder in decoding.

Iterate from step 2 to step 4 until a preset iteration limit is reached.",

For example, given two decoders 1 and 2 with hypotheses sets \u210b 1 and \u210b 2 , improvements on \u210b 1 enable 2 to improve \u210b 2 , and in turn \u210b 1 benefits from improved \u210b 2 , and so forth.",

This step seems to be redundant for CKY-style MT decoders {{6832980}}{{384994}} since the grouping is immediately available from decoders because all hypotheses spanning the same range of source sentence have been stacked together in the same chart cell. But to be a general framework, this step is necessary for some state-of-the-art phrase-based decoders {{794019}}{{1272090}} because in these decoders, hypotheses with different coverage vectors can co-exist in the same bin, or hypotheses associated with the same coverage vector might appear in different bins.",
              "Note that a member model does not enlarge the theoretical search space of its baseline model, the only change is hypothesis scoring. By rerunning a complete decoding process, member model can be applied to re-score all hypotheses explored by a decoder. Therefore step 3 can be viewed as full-scale hypothesis re-ranking because the re-ranking scope is beyond the limited n-best hypotheses currently cached in \u210b .",
              "In the implementation of member decoders, there are two major modifications compared to their baseline decoders. One is the support for co-decoding features, including computation of feature values and the use of augmented codecoding score function (Equation 2) for hypothesis ranking and pruning. The other is hypothesis grouping based on coverage vector and a mechanism to effectively access grouped hypotheses in step 2 and step 3."

However, the improvement margins are smaller than those of baseline decoders on both test sets. This could be the result of less diversified outputs from co-decoding than those from baseline decoders. In particular, the results for hypothesis selection are only slightly better than the best system in co-decoding.",

From the results we can see that combination based on co-decoding's outputs performs consistently better than that based on baseline decoders' outputs for all n-best sizes we experimented with. However, we did not observe any significant improvements for both combination schemes when n-best size is larger than 20.  Table 2 is that the performance gap between baseline decoders is narrowed through co-decoding. For example, the 1.5 points gap between SYS2 and SYS3 on NIST 2008 data set is narrowed to 0.5. Actually we find that the TER score between two member decoders' outputs are significantly reduced (as shown in Table 3), which indicates that the outputs become more similar due to the use of consensus information. For example, the TER score between SYS2 and SYS3 of the NIST 2008 outputs are reduced from 0.4238 to 0.2665.  Table 3: TER scores between co-decoding translation outputs",

Because Equation 3 is a general model that can be applied to both partial hypothesis and n-best (full hypothesis) re-scoring, we compare the results of both cases. Figure 3 shows the BLEU score curves with up to 1000 candidates used for reranking. In Figure 3, the suffix p denotes results for partial hypothesis re-ranking, and f for n-best re-ranking only. For partial hypothesis reranking, obtaining more top-ranked results requires increasing the beam size, which is not affordable for large numbers in experiments. We work around this issue by approximating beam sizes larger than 20 by only enlarging the beam size for the span covering the entire source sentence. From Figure 3 we can see that all decoders can gain improvements before the size of candidate set reaches 100. When the size is larger than 50, co-decoding performs consistently and significantly better than the re-ranking results on any baseline decoder's n-best outputs.  Figure 4 shows the BLEU scores of a twosystem co-decoding as a function of re-decoding iterations. From the results we can see that the results for both decoders converge after two iterations.",

The setting of iteration 1 can be viewed as the case of partial co-decoding, in which one decoder uses member model and the other keeps using baseline model. The results show that member models help each other: although improvements can be made using a single member model, best BLEU scores can only be achieved when both member models are used as shown by the results of iteration 2. The results also help justify the independent parameter estimation of member decoders described in Section 2.5, since optimizing the performance of one decoder will eventually bring performance improvements to all member decoders. Next we examine the impacts of different consensus-based features in co-decoding. Table 4 shows the comparison results of a two-system co-decoding using different settings of n-gram agreement and disagreement features. It is clearly shown that both n-gram agreement and disagreement types of features are helpful, and using them together is the best choice.  From the results we do not observe BLEU improvement for > 4. One reason could be that the data sparsity for high-order n-grams leads to over fitting on development data.",

      "Great, thank you for providing the manuscript! Based on the abstract, I will provide a scientific discussion on the new method of collaborative decoding (co-decoding) for improving machine translation accuracy.\n\nThe authors present a novel approach to improving machine translation accuracy by leveraging translation consensus between multiple machine translation decoders. Unlike system combination and MBR decoding, which post-process the n-best lists or word lattice of machine translation decoders, co-decoding involves multiple decoders collaborating by exchanging partial translation results in an iterative decoding approach. The authors employ n-gram agreement statistics between translations of multiple decoders to re-rank both full and partial hypotheses explored in decoding.\n\nThe manuscript presents experimental results on data sets for the NIST Chinese-to-English machine translation task, showing that the co-decoding method can significantly improve the accuracy of all baseline decoders. Moreover, the outputs from co-decoding can be used to further improve the results of system combination. This suggests that co-decoding has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of machine translation systems, particularly when combined with other decoding methods.\n\nOne interesting aspect of the co-decoding method is the use of n-gram agreement statistics to re-rank hypotheses. This approach allows the decoders to leverage the strengths of each other, as the agreement"

              "Genital chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease in Europe {{35702366}}{{not_in_s2orc}}. The English National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP), first introduced in 2003, offers opportunistic screening to sexually active young people aged 15-24 to reduce prevalence of chlamydia to prevent ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility in men and women {{not_in_s2orc}}. General practice is widely used by young people {{3236889}} and, therefore, provides an opportunity to raise awareness of, and provide, chlamydia screening.",
              "Health promotion posters and leaflets produced by the Department of Health and NCSP have been available to general practice through local chlamydia screening offices since the launch of the NCSP. The NCSP leaflet was first produced in April 2003 and was based on the leaflet originally used in the chlamydia screening pilot based in several health care settings including general practice {{not_in_s2orc}}. It was produced by the National Chlamydia Screening Programme Steering Group, which had GP representation, and was reviewed by other stakeholders. The leaflet was designed using a Department of Health (DH) format and to fit in with the ongoing DH Sexual Health Awareness campaign. It was designed to be used by all clinicians as part of the screening consent procedure. The posters were produced by the DH as part of a Sex Lottery campaign to be used in a range of Health Care settings. Additionally, many local areas produce their own promotional information materials. This reflects the devolved nature of the NSCP with much of the funding and responsibility for publicity and promotion at local level {{not_in_s2orc}}.",
              "We and others have found that many general practice staff admitted that they are reluctant to discuss sexual health opportunistically in all consultations {{39298935}}{{not_in_s2orc}}{{8898334}}{{not_in_s2orc}}{{16563662}}. Health promotion materials may help alleviate this barrier but there are no published studies of how the NCSP promotional materials are being used in England. The objective of this study was to explore the attitudes of general practice staff to health promotional materials aimed at increasing uptake of chlamydia screening, how staff used them, and explore other promotional strategies to encourage chlamydia screening. This was part of a larger qualitative study exploring general practice staffs' knowledge of the chlamydia screening programme and strategies they have used or suggest to encourage increased chlamydia screening within the general practice setting."

So that we could obtain the opinions of a wide range of general practices and staff, 25 high and low screening general practices were selected, using criterion based (purposive) sampling {{not_in_s2orc}}, from six NCSP areas in England who were encouraging screening within primary care. A member of the research team approached the practices by telephone and letter. We conducted eight focus groups with high screening practices (defined as those screening greater than 10% of their {{not_in_s2orc}}{{24870505}}{{8730405}}{{23334986}}{{7982863}}{{18431793}}{{10366727}}{{37420769}}{{not_in_s2orc}} year old target population), ten medium screening practices (between 3-10%) and 15 low screening practices (less than 3%).",
              "Two high and six low screening practices declined to participate due to time pressures or staff shortages. Participating practices were visited between November 2005 and April 2007 and included those in both urban and rural locations, with a mix of social class and ethnic populations. Although researchers did not know the practice screening rates before each visit, it was difficult to blind them to whether the practice was a high or low screener, as this usually became quite apparent during the discussions. Doctors, nurses, administrative staff and receptionists were invited to participate in the focus group. The focus group schedule used open questions which encouraged respondents to discuss candidly their experiences of the chlamydia screening programme. As part of the focus group, we sought information about their use and opinions of posters, leaflets and advertising to promote chlamydia screening. Researchers observed whether posters and leaflets were on display in reception and/or waiting areas when they visited the practice and recorded field notes following each focus group. Data were collected and analysed using a stepwise framework analytical approach {{146309938}}. Focus groups were audio-taped then transcribed and checked for accuracy against the tapes. EF and CMcN used QSR NVivo software (QSR International PTY Ltd. Melbourne http://www.qsrinternational.com) to identify codes, categories and themes from the data, using an inductive approach. This approach was used as we wanted to be open to using the depth and breadth of data collected to show the opinions and behaviour of the whole general practice team. Themes were then discussed at a project meeting and agreed by all the authors. If there were any disagreements, the text was re-examined and a consensus reached. Data collection and analysis occurred concurrently and we continued, through purposive sampling, to enrol and visit practices to enrich the data {{not_in_s2orc}}. The transcripts were then re-analysed by EF, using wordsearch, to ensure that any themes within the framework were not missed. The relationship between the practice screening rates (high, medium and low) and the data was examined. Quotations chosen demonstrate the different categories of data. These quotes were chosen as they highlighted the diversity of opinion in both high and low screening practices and differences between them.",
              "Ethical approval was obtained from the Multi-Research Ethics Committee for Scotland (No. 4/MRE10/41). Local research governance approval was obtained from the relevant Trusts. Information sheets were sent to the practices at least two weeks before the focus group and all staff gave informed written consent and were assured anonymity."

However, researchers observed that most posters displayed in general practices were aimed at elderly people or promoted immunisation; very few had chlamydia posters in communal areas.",

We could do a campaign for an evening a month but then because of the wall space and everything we have to do. I mean we used to have lots of all sorts of [different] posters, it was too messy and too much information to read. (GP and nurse FG18 low screening practice)",
              "Many staff thought posters caused offence. Several practices had to deal with complaints from older people about posters advertising chlamydia screening in the waiting room or lavatories and patients had either removed the poster themselves or had asked for it to be taken down.",

              "We didn't have very much advertising [about chlamydia] because that actually upset quite a few patients. Especially the elderly, they were quite upset with our advertising. So we had to take it down and they said they didn't really want it in their face when they were sitting in the waiting room. We had quite a few people complain. We also had a piece on safe sex as well. And I think two people found that quite offensive, so we had to redo the advertising side. (GP FG2 medium screening practice respondent 1 & 3)",
              "One low screening practice said there had been posters in nurses' rooms but these posters had been taken down and not replaced when the practice was refurbished. Many practices were concerned that posters may lose their impact if left on display.

            "Although two-thirds of practices reported they were displaying posters and leaflets they were not prominently displayed in most practices. Only a minority of practices reported actively using the posters and leaflets on an ongoing basis, to raise the visual profile of chlamydia screening, in reception, waiting areas, lavatories and consulting rooms. Although about half the practices were using posters and leaflets, many of these had low rates of screening and were not backing up the advertising by routinely offering opportunistic screening to their target population. However, the study design does not allow us to say that the use of promotional materials alone will increase screening rates. It was interesting that some staff in many practices thought using posters and leaflets would cause offence or embarrassment to their patients. Staff thought this could be decreased by using more discrete posters and smaller leaflets or by using envelopes. Distribution of chlamydia leaflets by receptionists was thought to be inappropriate by some practices, as they thought patients would be offended when being offered a leaflet in public waiting areas or reception. Practices suggested other ways to promote chlamydia screening including a national advertising campaign and sending letters to patients' homes."

Several studies exploring the use of promotional materials in other sexual health areas found that young patients are less likely to read posters than older patients {{32619948}}{{22482571}}{{not_in_s2orc}}. These authors found that the public nature of waiting rooms and reception areas may inhibit patients collecting materials covering sexual health. Leaflets have been given to patients by GUM clinic receptionists to promote HIV testing {{32619948}}{{22482571}}. Ivens and Sabin found that although patients' knowledge of HIV increased they were not more likely to accept a test compared to those offered a verbal discussion {{22482571}}. A recent general practice postal survey also shows that use of promotional materials covering sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is low in Australia -only one-fifth of GP respondents reported that they displayed posters covering STIs in their waiting room {{24870505}}.",

Posters and leaflets in health, education and recreation centres, an internet web page, radio, television and newspaper interviews, were used to encourage young people to request a test kit for chlamydia. It resulted in a large proportion of requests for test kits from those ineligible to receive them {{8730405}}, which indicates that leaflets need to be targeted at the at-risk population. This was done by several of the practices in our study.",

In a US study, although 60% of patients noticed a poster campaign inviting patients in a US family practice clinic to discuss weight loss, the posters did not increase the proportion of patients reporting a change in patient-physician conversations about weight loss {{23334986}}. This work suggests that posters alone will not increase uptake of any health intervention without the willingness of health professionals to follow-up the advertising with offers to participate in screening.",
            "Edwards et al's 2003 systematic review of communicating individual risk in screening programmes suggests that communication understanding is associated with higher uptake of tests, although none of the studies included in this review used posters or patient leaflet {{7982863}}. The interventions described were risk appraisal questionnaires, or tailored printed materials and counselling. These authors point out that further evaluation of strategies is needed to promote informed decision-making and increase uptake of screening tests. O'Connor et al's 1997 systematic review found that decision aids were better than usual care for patient facing screening or treatment decisions {{18431793}}. Writ-ten decision aids supported patients' decisions by making them feel better informed {{18431793}}. This study points out that decision aids increased preferences for some interventions (for example Hepatitis B vaccinations) but not others (dental surgery) through increasing patients' knowledge but variations exist in behaviour to accept screening or treatment."

            "This is the first study to elicit the views of general practice staff, using qualitative methods, about NCSP chlamydia posters and leaflets. We expect that other general practices would show similar attitudes and beliefs to those demonstrated by the staff in this study. We used a focus group approach. Although interviews may have allowed more junior members of the team and non clinical staff to speak more frankly about their views, we decided on the focus group setting as this is the usual setting for practice meetings and how the chlamydia screening coordinators approach the practice to discuss screening. Our perception was that all staff were given the opportunity to vocalise their attitudes to screening. The questions covering promotional materials formed part of the longer focus groups and, therefore, we may have obtained even more detailed data if we had concentrated on a single area, but it is likely that practices and many staff may have declined to participate if covering just this narrower topic. Although specific open questions were used about posters and leaflets, we did not show participants the NCSP leaflets or posters. EF has nursing and research training and has no direct involvement in the NCSP, so this allowed her to approach the work without any preconceptions. We were not able to obtain patients' views of NCSP promotional materials, as it was outside the scope of this study, but is the focus of future work. The study design did not allow us to say whether the use of promotional materials will increase chlamydia screening.

Leaflets need to be developed in different formats to suit different scenarios in the general practice setting. Credit card sized discrete leaflets would be more suited to receptions and waiting room areas, whereas longer leaflets are more suitable for clinicians to distribute as screening is offered. As staff suggested, in areas of high ethnicity the NCSP should consider leaflets in different languages and leaflets should inform young people how often they should be screened.",
            "Chlamydia coordinators need to promote and audit the use and display of chlamydia screening promotional materials more actively across all general practices registered with the chlamydia screening programme. Coordinators need to emphasise to practice staff that leaflets and posters need to be followed up with a verbal offer of screening opportunistically whenever a 15-24 year old visits the practice. All practice staff will need training on how to approach this.",
            "In summary, the NCSP and coordinators of the service at PCT level should:",
            "Make posters more suitable for a general practice setting Make posters acceptable to elderly patients who may also view them Make leaflets less obviously about chlamydia so that they can be given to or picked up by patients without embarrassment Produce pocket or credit card sized leaflets In areas of high ethnicity, consider leaflets in different languages, or use more pictorial messages Audit use and display of posters and leaflets Ensure leaflets cover how often young people should be screened Educate practice staff on how to follow up leaflets and poster use with offer of a chlamydia screen"

            "The NCSP needs to raise the profile of chlamydia screening in general practice. Practice staff need to discuss, with their screening coordinator, how the practice can promote chlamydia screening most effectively using promotional materials. The posters need to be displayed more prominently, so that they are more visible to young people, and practices should consider how they can increase distribution of leaflets through receptionists and clinicians. Practices need to review their use and display of sexual health promotion materials at least six monthly, as many professionals recognised that these lose their impact if not changed regularly.",
            "Education to change practice staffs' attitudes towards sexual health is needed to reduce their worries and possible prejudices about displaying the chlamydia materials and following up with screening offers. A behavioural intervention approach using the Theory of Planned Behaviour {{37420769}} might be appropriate to address these issues. The pro-motional materials will be part of this approach to help normalise screening within the practice setting and make it more acceptable to staff and patients to offer screening opportunistically. Staff attitude to screening can also be influenced by education about the epidemiology and sequelae of chlamydia and the value of screening. Role play, videos or IT based materials can be used to increase practice staffs' confidence to be able to follow up poster displays and leaflets with verbal offers of chlamydia screening whenever they see a 15-24 year old patient. The education will need to be tailored for clinicians or the different staff; that is health care assistants and receptionists.",
            "In summary, general practice staff should:",
            "Increase awareness of all staff of NCSP and the posters and leaflets available Display posters and leaflets more prominently Display leaflets where they can be easily picked up by young people Review display of leaflets and posters regularly, e.g. six monthly",
            "Agree on when leaflets should be offered to patients by receptionists Agree on when leaflets should be offered to patients by health-care assistants Agree on when leaflets should be offered by patients by nurses and doctors Order more discrete posters Order smaller more discrete leaflets Consider chlamydia envelopes if leaflets are not considered discrete enough for patients Undertake role play or video based education on how staff can offer leaflets Undertake role play or video based education on how staff can follow-up poster advertising in waiting room and patient leaflets with a screening offer Consider postal invitations for chlamydia screening"

The study provides valuable insights into the barriers and opportunities for promoting chlamydia screening in primary care settings.\n\nThe results of the study indicate that while two-thirds of screening practices displayed posters and leaflets, they were not always prominently displayed. This suggests that there may be a lack of commitment to promoting chlamydia screening within these practices.
