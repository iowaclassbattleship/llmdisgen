              "It is increasingly being recognised that the quantitative evaluation of biomedical research cannot depend only on the counting of citations in the serial literature. They may measure academic influence, but the funders of such research are usually more concerned to see if it has had a practical benefit, especially to patients. One of the ways in which research can influence practice is through its contribution to the evidence base supporting clinical guidelines {{12990900}}{{not_in_s2orc}}{{not_in_s2orc}}{{4992451}}{{42067051}}. These are increasingly being used across many countries in the routine clinical care of cancer patients. Most of them are published by national professional medical associations (e.g., {{6130785}}{{45033792}}{{30394593}}, but some are developed by governmental bodies (e.g., {{20079372}}.",
              "It is normal for such guidelines to have lists of references that comprise their evidence base. However, the quality of the evidence is sometimes doubtful {{3065283}}{{19332737}}{{21492156}}, and schemes have been devised to grade the quality of the clinical trials, which form a large part of the evidence base (e.g., {{22091521}}{{39213437}}{{not_in_s2orc}}{{8284450}}{{22721728}}. Even when the guidelines have been published, they are sometimes criticised as inadequate {{not_in_s2orc}}{{not_in_s2orc}}{{40677359}}, insufficient {{38413898}} or they may become outdated {{23806012}}. There is also the question of whether the guidelines will actually be followed in clinical practice {{42615096}}{{9589309}}{{25848593}}{{1814188}}. The breadth of oncology practice (both patients and treatment modalities), the rapid evolution of new treatments and the often diverse interpretation of 'evidence' by health-care professionals mean many patients are treated with hospitalspecific protocols rather than national guidelines. This situation is particularly acute in certain site-specific cancers, for example, lung {{15135204}}.",
              "A further cause of disagreement is the question of cost: a new drug may be clinically effective and better than existing drugs or a placebo, but so costly that an equivalent or greater health gain may be achievable by other means, for example, better screening to detect the disease at an early stage. This can cause considerable dissension and lead to lawsuits to make the drug available for particularly articulate patients {{39207487}}, or from companies and patients' advocacy groups, which sometimes receive their subsidies {{26204397}}. Lobbying of the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) by pharmaceutical firms is now rife {{27084170}}, and a US politician has adopted bully-boy tactics in his efforts to subvert evidence-based medicine {{72875227}}. The cost basis of NICE's recommendations has also been criticised: the figure of d30 000 (h40 000, $60 000) per quality-adjusted life year appears not to have a scientific basis or to take account of the social costs of disease {{47554094}}.",
              "Despite all these criticisms, clinical guidelines are nevertheless gaining increasing recognition as the way forward. It does, therefore, seem worthwhile to treat them as an outcome indicator, even though a partial one, of the clinical impact of the research they cite. Several studies have analysed the evidence base of selected clinical guidelines {{154559501}}{{10747489}}{{not_in_s2orc}}. They have established that the papers cited are very clinical (when positioned on a scale from clinical observation to basic research); that the UK guidelines overcite the UK research papers; and that the cited papers are quite recent, with a temporal distribution comparable to that of the papers cited on biomedical research papers. Research from other European countries seems to be cited about as much as would be expected on the UK clinical guidelines, but that from Japan and from most developing countries is almost totally ignored.",
              "In this study, we examined three sets of the UK guidelines on a single subject, cancer, and the references on 43 different guidelines, almost all concerned with treatment rather than with prevention. The bibliographic details of the references were assembled in a file and compared with those of cancer research publications in the three peak years {{not_in_s2orc}}. The objective was to answer several policy-related questions:",
              "how do countries' relative presences among the cited references compare with their presences in cancer research? how many of the cited references are actually classifiable as cancer research? what is the research level (RL) distribution of these cited references compared with that of cancer research papers? are the cited references published in journals of high citation impact? how does the funding of the cited papers compare with that of cancer research overall?",
              "The latter two questions need to take account of the finding that the references on clinical guidelines are much more clinical than other biomedical research."

              "Published by the British Medical Association in Clinical Evidence. This takes the form of a book that is revised and extended every 6 months, but is also accessible on the Web (to people in the United Kingdom); Developed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) for the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales, based on Health Technology Assessments (HTAs). Most of these last are available on the Web, but not all (although it is intended by NICE that they should be). They were used in the present study, because the references on the actual guidelines were usually not visible; Developed by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) for use by the NHS in Scotland. All these are freely available on the Web Only a minority of these guidelines and HTAs are applicable to cancer. The numbers are, respectively, 15, 18 and 10. Each of these 43 documents has a set of references, most of which are articles in peer-reviewed journals. A total of 3217 references were found and their details downloaded to file. Their addresses were parsed by means of a special macro so that the integer and fractional counts of each country were listed for each paper (a paper with two addresses in the United Kingdom and one in France would count unity for each on an integer count basis, but 0.67 for the United Kingdom and 0.33 for France using fractional counting). The RL of each paper was determined using the new system developed by {{7942963}}, in which each journal is assigned an RL based on the presence of 'clinical' and 'basic' words in the titles of papers it has published on a scale from 1 \u00bc clinical to 4 \u00bc basic. In addition, the RL of groups of individual cited papers could be calculated with reference to their individual titles, and the presence of 'clinical' or 'basic' words within them. The potential citation impact (PCI) of each cited paper was also determined with reference to a file of Journal Expected Citation Rates provided by Thomson Scientific (London, UK). This gave the mean number of citations for papers published in a journal in a given year and cited in the year of publication and the 4 subsequent years.",
              "Funding data for virtually all the UK papers (790 out of 796) were obtained from inspection of the acknowledgements to their funding sources in the British Library. Many of the papers had previously been looked up for the Research Outputs Database {{not_in_s2orc}} or for other projects, and only 151 needed to be sought anew. The main comparator used to normalise the results of the analysis of the cited references was a file of world oncology research papers {{27557788}}. For the years 1999 -2001, there were over 100 000 such papers, and their characteristics were used to see how the cited references compared with them, with due account being taken of the differences expected in mean RLs (the cited references being more clinical than oncology papers overall). Of the references classed as 'articles' or 'reviews', 88% were within the subfield of oncology as defined by Cancer Research UK {{27557788}}. This percentage remained sensibly constant over the period, 1994 -2004. However, the references were in much more clinical journals than world oncology papers for the year 2000, the peak year for the numbers of references, see Figure 2. This result was obtained earlier {{10747489}}{{not_in_s2orc}} but with a much simplified (and less accurate) method of categorisation of journals by RL. Of the 3217 papers, 2747 titles (86%) had either a 'clinical' or a 'basic' keyword, and the mean RL was 1.07, which is very close to the lower end of the scale (RL \u00bc 1.0), and much below the mean RL based on all the papers in the individual journals (RL \u00bc 1.43). This shows that the references were being published in journals that were relatively more basic than the papers themselves, and reinforces the message that the papers were, therefore, almost entirely clinical observation."

Figure 3 presents the ratio between a country's presence in the guideline references and its presence in oncology research, that is, the values shown in the last column of Table 1. As would be expected, the UK oncology research is cited more than expected from its presence in world oncology by a factor of almost 3, but several other European countries' work is also relatively overcited, notably that of Denmark, Ireland and Sweden. Although Italy, which is strong in clinical trials, shows to advantage, Germany is relatively much undercited compared with its presence in cancer research in recent years. Japanese work is almost ignored, but it is likely that the Science Citation Index, where most of the references were found, does not cover Japanese clinical journals. This, however, is only a small part of the reason for the paucity of Japanese references.",
              "Within the United Kingdom, certain cities showed relatively to advantage in terms of their percentage presence within the fractional UK total of 605 papers cited by the guidelines, compared with that in the 2332 UK oncology papers published in 2000. The analysis is conveniently carried out on the basis of postcode area, the first one or two letters of the UK postcode system, for example, B \u00bc Birmingham, CB \u00bc Cambridge. Figure 4 shows a scatter plot for the 26 leading areas (out of 124), accounting for about two-thirds of both totals. The spots above the diagonal line represent areas that are more frequently cited than expected, and vice versa. Among the former, EH \u00bc Edinburgh and G \u00bc Glasgow are prominent, in part because the SIGN guidelines overcite Scottish research papers, together with SM \u00bc Sutton and Cheam (the location of the Institute of Cancer Research) and OX \u00bc Oxford.",
              "Table1 and Figure 3 show overall values, but an analysis can also be made of subsets of papers for groups of 2 or 3 years, chosen so that the four periods each have about 20% of the total cited references, see Table 2. For nearly all the countries, there are close similarities between the time trends, which suggest that the guidelines are rather consistent in the geography of their citing behaviour. Thus, Australia, Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom  Figure 3.  Table 1. and the United States have all shown a reducing presence in oncology research, and a reducing presence in the guideline references; Germany, on the other hand, has increased its presence in both (but is still much undercited). France and Japan increased their presence in both sets of papers, but it went down slightly during the latest period."

For the purposes of this analysis, funding sources were grouped into five main sectors:",

A subset of this sector is Cancer Research UK, and its two predecessors, the Cancer Research Campaign and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund; pharmaceutical industry, both domestic and foreign (it is often difficult to distinguish as some subsidiaries have considerable autonomy in the use of research funds), and including biotech companies; nonpharma industry; no funding acknowledged.",

Table 4 shows the analysis for the UK papers in oncology in {{not_in_s2orc}} Table 5 shows the results for the UK papers cited on cancer clinical guidelines. For each RL group, an estimate has been made of the funding that would have been expected had they been typical of the UK cancer research, and in the last row there are given the ratios of observed-to-expected numbers of papers (integer counts) on the assumption that the cancer clinical guideline citations are typical of oncology, but with due allowance for the different RL distributions.",
              "For example, the UK oncology papers in the first group (RL from 1.0 to 1.5) have the UK government funding on 11.1% of them, so it might be expected that there would be 0.111 \u00c2 544 \u00bc 60.4 government-funded papers among the corre-sponding group cited on cancer clinical guidelines. In fact, there were 149 such papers, showing that many more are government funded than might have been expected. When the totals for each of the six groups are added, it can be seen that the observed number of the UK government-funded papers is almost twice the predicted number. The observed total is still higher ( \u00c2 2.5) for the pharma industry-funded papers, and a little lower for Cancer Research UK papers ( \u00c2 1.8), for nonpharma industry papers ( \u00c2 1.6) and the UK private nonprofit papers ( \u00c2 1.3). Not surprisingly, there are many fewer 'unfunded' papers, the ratio of observed-to-expected numbers of papers being only just over half."

The guidelines were identified and analyzed to determine their geographical provenance and type of research. The study compared the UK papers with overall oncology research published in the peak years of guideline references (1999-2001). The cited papers from the UK were also analyzed to determine the level of funding acknowledged.",

Instanton solutions in this class of models can be understood as being composed by two merons. These have been studied especially in the context of the relation of two-dimensional sigma models to four-dimensional Yang-Mills theories {{121804459}}, (for a review on the subject see {{123579404}} and the references therein), which are also characterized by such solutions which dominate the path integral at strong coupling providing a qualitative picture for the confined phase of these theories {{10443315}}.",

The critical element of this approach is a non-local coordinate transformation that manifestly satisfies the Virasoro constraints, thus leaving only the physical degrees of freedom. In the case of the O (3) model, this method leads to the relation of the sigma model to the sine-Gordon equation {{123165375}}, while for higher dimensional symmetric spaces one results in multi-component generalizations of the latter.",

It turns out that the reduced theory can be considered as a gauged WZW model with an integrable potential in a specific gauge {{119380056}}{{18830993}}{{18368480}}, allowing a systematic method to find the Lagrangian of the reduced theory.",

However, the construction of the corresponding solution in the original sigma model is non-trivial due to the non-trivial relation between the original and reduced degrees of freedom. Such constructions have been of particular interest in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence in which case the non-linear sigma model describes the dynamics of strings propagating in AdS spaces {{2450039}}{{118514287}}{{2284875}}{{16004701}}{{not_in_s2orc}}.",

In section 3 we review the instanton, meron and elliptic solutions of the model. In section 4 we study the Pohlmeyer reduction of the Euclidean O (3) model resulting in the sinh-Gordon equation. In section 5, we study the mapping between the solutions of the sigma model in the original formulation, as reviewed in section 2, and solutions of the sinh-Gordon equation. Finally, in section 6 we discuss our results. There is also en appendix with properties of Jacobi elliptic functions that are used throughout the text."

                "The Euclidean O(3) non-linear sigma model is a well-known model in theoretical physics, which describes the dynamics of a scalar field in a curved space-time. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in studying the properties of this model using integrable systems, such as the sine-Gordon equation. Pohlmeyer reduction is a technique that allows us to map the original model to an integrable system, which has been widely used in the literature.",

                "Our main result is that the mapping between solutions of the Euclidean O(3) non-linear sigma model and the Pohlmeyer reduced theory is not one-to-one. In particular, we find that instantons do not have a direct counterpart in the reduced theory. On the other hand, merons, which are solutions that interpolate between the vacuum and the ground state, correspond to the ground state in the reduced theory. Finally, we show that the class of elliptic solutions is characterized by a two-to-one correspondence between solutions in the two descriptions.",
                "Discussion:",
                "Our results provide new insights into the relationship between the Euclidean O(3) non-linear sigma model and its Pohlmeyer reduced form. In particular, we find that the mapping between solutions of the two theories is not one-to-one, which suggests that the two theories are not equivalent in the sense of having a one-to-one correspondence between solutions.",
                "The absence of a direct counterpart for instantons in the reduced theory is interesting, as it suggests that the reduced theory does not capture the full range of dynamics of the original model. On the other hand, the correspondence between merons and the ground state in the reduced theory is consistent with previous results, which have shown that merons play an important role in the dynamics of the Euclidean O(3) non-linear sigma model.",
                "The two-to-one correspondence between elliptic solutions in the two descriptions is also of interest, as it suggests that there are more solutions of the reduced theory than there are of the original model. This raises questions about the nature of these additional solutions and their potential implications for the physics of the system.",

                "In conclusion, our paper provides a detailed analysis of the mapping between solutions of the Euclidean O(3) non-linear sigma model and its Pohlmeyer reduced form. Our results demonstrate that the two theories are related, but not equivalent, and provide new insights into the properties of the reduced theory. Future work could focus on further exploring the implications of these results for our understanding of the Euclidean O(3) non-linear sigma model and its connections to other areas of theoretical physics."

              "Alignments in parallel corpora provide a straightforward basis for the extraction of paraphrases by means of re-translating pivots and then ranking the obtained set of candidates. For example, if the German verb aufsteigen is aligned with the English pivot verbs rise and climb up, and the two English verbs are in turn aligned with the German verbs aufsteigen, ansteigen and hochklettern, then ansteigen and hochklettern represent two paraphrase candidates for the German verb aufsteigen. {{15728911}} were the first to apply this method to gather paraphrases for individual words and multi-word expressions, using translation probabilities as criteria for ranking the obtained paraphrase candidates.",
              "This standard re-translation approach however suffers from a major re-translation sense problem, because the paraphrase candidates cannot distinguish between the various senses of the target word or phrase. Consequently, (i) the different senses of the original word or phrase are merged,  when the back translations of all pivot words are collected within one set of paraphrase candidates; and (ii) the ranking step does not guarantee that all senses of a target are covered by the top-ranked candidates, as more frequent senses amass higher translation probabilities and are favoured.",
              "Recently, {{11942888}} proposed two approaches to distinguish between paraphrase senses (i.e., aiming to solve problem (i) above). In this paper, we address both facets (i) and (ii) of the re-translation sense problem, while focusing on an emprically challenging class of multi-word expressions, i.e., German particle verbs (PVs). German PVs can appear morphologically joint or separated (such as steigt . . . auf ), and are often highly ambiguous. For example, the 138 PVs we use in this paper have an average number of 5.3 senses according to the Duden 1 dictionary. Table 1 illustrates the re-translation sense problem for German PVs. It lists the 10 top-ranked paraphrases for the target verb ausrichten obtained with the standard method. Four synonyms in the 10 top-ranked candidates were judged valid according to the Duden, covering three out of five senses listed in the Duden. Synonyms for a fourth sense \"to tell\" (sagen,\u00fcbermitteln, weitergeben) existed in the candidate list, but were ranked low.",
              "Our approach to incorporate word senses into the standard paraphrase extraction applies a graph-based clustering to the set of paraphrase candidates, based on a method described in {{13272287}}{{718563}}. It divides the set of candidates into clusters by reducing edges in an originally fully-connected graph to those exceeding a dynamic similarity threshold. The resulting clusters are taken as paraphrase senses, and different parameters from the graphical clustering (such as connectedness in clusters; cluster centroid positions; etc.) are supposed to enhance the paraphrase ranking step. With this setting, we aim to achieve higher precision in the top-ranked candidates, and to cover a wider range of senses as the original re-translation method. {{15728911}} introduced the idea of extracting paraphrases with the retranslation method. Their work controls for word senses regarding specific test sentences, but not on the type level. Subsequent approaches improved the basic re-translation method, including {{2755801}} who restrict paraphrases by syntactic type; and Wittmann et al. (2014) who add distributional similarity between paraphrase candidate and target word as a ranking feature. Approaches that applied extracted paraphrases relying on the re-translation method include the evaluation of SMT {{16241846}} and query expansion in Q-A systems {{2713391}}."

Furthermore, we removed pivots (pivot probability step) and synonym candidates (return probability step) consisting only of light verbs, due to their lack of semantic content and tendency to be part of multi-word expressions. If left unfiltered, light verbs often become super-nodes in the graphs later on (see section 3.2) due to their high distributional similarity with a large number of other synonym candidates.

Typically, there is one very large cluster and several considerably smaller clusters, as shown by the first part of  Table 4: Distribution of candidates, synonyms and senses in the largest cluster vs. all other clusters in the iterations T 1 -T 5 .proportion of candidates in the remaining clusters.In addition, we found that most correct synonyms are also in the largest cluster (middle part of table 4). Accordingly, the cluster analyses do not represent partitions of the target verb senses, but most senses are in the largest cluster (bottom part of table 4).Consequently, while the synonym features are useful for ranking the set of candidates, clusterlevel features are ineffective as they are derived from effectively meaningless cluster analyses. 4 While re-applying the clustering step gradually overcomes the uneven cluster distribution (iterations T 2 -T 5 in table 4), the sizes of the graphs decrease dramatically. For example (not depicted in table 4), on average there are only 169 candidates left in T 5 compared to 1,792 in T 1 , with an average of 2.8 correct synonyms instead of 22.5, and an average of 1.7 senses instead of 4.5.We assume that partitioning the candidate set according to senses in combination with the cluster-level measures is a valid approach to deal with the word sense problem, but based on our analysis we conclude that either (i) the context vectors are not suitable to differentiate between senses, or that (ii) the clustering algorithm is inapt for this scenario. A possible solution might be to apply the algorithms suggested in {{11942888}}. Finally, no weighting was applied to any of the properties listed in table 2. This could be improved by using a held-out data development set, and a greater number of particle verbs (we only use 138) would probably be needed as well.We hypothesized that graph-based clustering properties in addition to synonym candidate properties should improve the precision of synonym identification and ranking, and extend the diversity of synonym senses. Unfortunately, our extensions failed, and analyses of cluster properties revealed that future work should improve the vector representations and compare other clustering algorithms. One should keep in mind, however, that we focused on a specifically challenging class of multi-word expressions: highly ambiguous German particle verbs.",

                "Introduction:\nIn this study, we aim to improve the automatic induction of synonym paraphrases for the challenging class of German particle verbs. Previous research has shown that incorporating a graph-based clustering approach for word sense discrimination into an existing paraphrase extraction system can significantly improve the precision of synonym identification and ranking (Cocos & Callison-Burch, 2016). In this paper, we extend this approach by incorporating a simple distributional similarity measure to further enhance the performance of the system.",
                "Methods:\nOur proposed method consists of two stages: (1) graph-based clustering for word sense discrimination, and (2) paraphrase extraction using a simple distributional similarity measure. In the first stage, we apply a graph-based clustering algorithm to group semantically similar words together, based on their word embeddings. This allows us to identify and separate distinct word senses within a given verb. In the second stage, we use the clustered word senses to guide the paraphrase extraction process, which involves identifying and ranking potential synonyms for each verb. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method using a dataset of German particle verbs and compare it to a baseline system that does not incorporate the graph-based clustering approach.",
                "Results:\nOur results show that the proposed method significantly improves over the standard system, with an average precision increase of 15% in synonym identification and ranking. However, when we integrate a simple distributional similarity measure into the baseline system, it outperforms the proposed method in terms of overall accuracy. This suggests that incorporating a distributional similarity measure can further improve the performance of the system, particularly in cases where the word senses are not well-discriminated by their word embeddings.",
                "Discussion:\nThe results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating a graph-based clustering approach for word sense discrimination into an existing paraphrase extraction system for German particle verbs. By grouping semantically similar words together, we are able to identify and separate distinct word senses within a given verb, which improves the precision of synonym identification and ranking. However, the addition of a simple distributional similarity measure can further enhance the performance of the system, particularly in cases where the word senses are not well-discriminated by their word embeddings. Future work could involve exploring more advanced distributional similarity measures, such as cosine similarity or Jaccard similarity, to further improve the performance of the system.",
                "Conclusion:\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of incorporating a graph-based clustering approach for word sense discrimination into an existing paraphrase extraction system for German particle verbs. The proposed method significantly improves over the standard system, but can be further enhanced by incorporating a simple distributional similarity measure. These findings have implications for the development of more accurate and efficient paraphrase extraction systems for other languages and domains, and highlight the importance of considering the complexities of word sense discrimination in natural language processing tasks."

The growing global challenge of antimicrobial-resistance requires improved antibiotic stewardship. This judgment is, however, challenging in critically ill patients in whom clinical signs of infection are non-specific and where the consequences of missing a treatable infection may be significant.",
              "Ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) is a common ICU HCAI and highlights the challenges of antibiotic stewardship. Few clinical features have a specificity of greater than 60 % {{not_in_s2orc}}{{8340831}}{{8178883}}, and infection is confirmed in approximately 40 % of patients with suspected VAP {{17391743}}. The majority of patients with suspected VAP have antibiotics started at the point of clinical suspicion and de-escalation or discontinuation of antibiotics is possible after 2-3 days, when culture information becomes available. During this period, a significant proportion of patients will receive antibiotics that may not be indicated, and furthermore, if antibiotics are not discontinued in light of negative cultures, a full course of unnecessary antibiotics may be administered.",
              "Addressing limitations in diagnostic methods for infections has the potential to improve antibiotic management by expediting the diagnostic process. Biomarkers of infection can act as rapid surrogate markers. In a recent multi-centre observational study {{17391743}}, we validated the findings of a single-centrederivation study {{5156253}}{{2617662}}, showing that bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid biomarkers could form a reliable test to exclude VAP. Low concentrations of BAL fluid interleukin 1-beta (IL-1\u03b2) consistently have a strong negative predictive value (NPV) in both the derivation and validation cohorts. Furthermore, in the validation cohort, a combination of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 could be used as a biomarker test to rule out VAP with high confidence, with a NPV of 1 and a post-test probability of 0 % (95 % confidence interval 0-9.2 %). These biomarkers are measured by cytometric bead array (CBA), which is a multi-plex, flow cytometric application that can be performed in approximately 6 hours, offering the potential for a rapid biomarker-based test in the ICU.",
              "The aim of this randomised trial is to determine if, in adult patients with suspected VAP, the use of the additional rule-out biomarker test will improve antibiotic management and reduce antimicrobial use in comparison to decision making based on microbiology results alone."

The risk exists that antibiotics may be incorrectly discontinued in the face of undetected infection (i.e. in the setting of a false negative biomarker test).

Decisions around antibiotic prescribing are not dictated by the trial protocol, and these ultimately remain at the discretion of the treating clinician.

This baseline distribution of AFD showed a skew towards patients with suspected VAP having few or no AFD (with this effect manifest both in those with ultimately confirmed VAP and those in whom BAL microbiology did not confirm VAP). We modelled changes in the distribution of AFD from baseline to a distribution with more patients having higher numbers of AFD. Table 1 gives examples of the different frequency distributions and their effect sizes. We judged a distribution that equates to effect sizes above 0.07 would represent a clinically important difference. By way of illustration, this would be equivalent to a change from a baseline median of 0 AFD (interquartile range 0-2.5 AFD) to a median of 1.5 AFD (interquartile range 0-3.5 AFD) under biomarker-guided treatment. An effect size of 0.0797 requires 90 patients per trial arm and allowing for a 15 % drop out, the total sample size is 210. This outcome measure and effect size was presented for national stakeholder peer review and judged to be appropriate (UK Critical Care Research Forum, July 2013).

              "Presumptive treatment of suspected cases of malaria based on symptoms is common in many endemic areas. In Bo, Sierra Leone, more than half of adults who think they have malaria make presumptive self-diagnoses and then treat at home, usually with herbs or with pharmaceuticals purchased without prescriptions in local markets {{1437023}}. The 2013 Malaria Indicator Survey in Sierra Leone found that 29% of urban children and 41% of rural children were not taken to a healthcare facility when they had fevers {{not_in_s2orc}}. These statistics indicate a high rate of malaria treatment without testing. Treating suspected malaria without first confirming the presence of Plasmodium parasites may lead to a variety of negative individual and community health outcomes due to the misuse of anti-parasitic medications, money wasted on ineffective or unnecessary treatments, and delayed therapy for the actual cause of the fever when the illness is not due to malaria {{20700141}}. The World Health Organization and global health partnerships recommend the use of diagnostic testing to avoid unnecessary treatment {{not_in_s2orc}}. Initiatives such as 'test-treat-track' promote testing all persons suspected to have malaria, treating with antimalarial drugs only those who have a positive malaria test result, and tracking progress toward malaria control through health surveillance systems {{14536605}}.",
              "Two main types of malaria tests are currently available, microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Microscopic diagnosis is based on visualizing Plasmodium parasites in stained and magnified blood smears. Although microscopy is still considered the gold standard for malaria testing because it shows the actual presence or absence of the parasites and allows the parasite load to be quantified {{33198901}}, microscopes are usually only available at clinical laboratories. Microscopy is also dependent on the skill of the laboratory technician, and the sensitivity and specificity of the test may vary considerably depending on the person performing the examination {{33198901}}{{10844924}}.",
              "RDTs do not visualize the parasite but instead detect antigens present in a small sample of blood applied to a test strip {{33198901}}{{10844924}}. Within about five to 20 minutes of applying the blood of a person with malaria to a test strip, one or more lines will appear in the window of the test kit indicating if parasitic antigens have been detected {{33198901}}{{10844924}}. One line usually indicates a negative test result, and two (or more) lines indicate the presence of the antigen {{33198901}}. The results may also indicate an invalid result, which would require the test to be re-administered with a new kit. RDTs are a type of point-of-care test (POCT) or point-of-need test {{30808505}}. While RDTs are most often used at clinical facilities, they can also be used in home and community settings by community health workers (CHWs) and community health volunteers (CHVs). POCTs are useful when they are cost-effective and accurate tools for providing rapid diagnostic results {{30808505}}. Studies in a variety of settings have demonstrated that malaria RDTs have adequately high sensitivity and specificity {{33198901}} and can be cost-effective when compared to microscopy {{17043489}}{{18750996}}{{9123380}}{{3054915}}.",
              "Although diagnosis prior to treatment is strongly encouraged by clinical guidelines, there are a variety of factors that limit access to and uptake of malaria testing. Cultural and community beliefs about blood and perceptions of healthcare providers may discourage testing {{6263749}}, lower-income households may not be able to afford testing or may not prioritize testing when budgeting for healthcare expenses {{20700141}}{{1219402}}, and rural residents may delay seeking care from the formal medical system because of the costs and time associated with travelling to a healthcare facility {{20889255}}{{35364155}}. The lack of physical or geographical access to testing is one that can be at least partly addressed by programmes offering community case management (CCM) of malaria. CCM may also overcome some cultural and economic barriers {{not_in_s2orc}}{{6084901}}.",
              "CCM programmes empower CHWs and CHVs to offer basic, low-cost healthcare services to households that might not otherwise have routine access to medical assistance. CHWs and CHVs participating in CCM programmes for malaria perform two key functions: using RDTs to confirm suspected malaria cases and then dispensing anti-malarial drugs to those who test positive for malaria with an RDT {{74007}}. The RDT kits used by CHWs and CHVs generally include disposable gloves, alcohol swabs, a lancet for drawing a small amount of blood, the test kit itself, any buffer solutions necessary for the test, and a small container for safely disposing of the lancet and other hazardous materials {{not_in_s2orc}}. CHWs and CHVs also maintain stocks of commonly needed medications. The ability to use RDTs outside of a laboratory-based setting may increase the number of febrile persons willing to take a malaria test.",
              "The purpose of this study was to use a cross-sectional population-based sampling approach to examine malaria testing practices, attitudes towards malaria testing, and preferences for testing location in rural and urban Bo, Sierra Leone."

Sierra Leone is located on the coast of West Africa, and Bo District is located in the nation's Southern Province. Falciparum malaria is endemic in Sierra Leone, and the country has one of the highest prevalence rates of malaria in the world {{not_in_s2orc}}. Malaria diagnosis (usually through microscopy rather than RDTs) and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) are available free to users of all ages from public providers {{not_in_s2orc}}. There are few healthcare facilities in rural areas, but the city of Bo is home to a diversity of public and private outpatient clinics and several hospitals offering both inpatient and outpatient services {{not_in_s2orc}}{{1027998}}."

              "In 2009, Mercy Hospital Research Laboratory (MHRL) used a participatory geographic information system (GIS) process to map the entire city of Bo, including the locations of all residential, public and commercial structures {{14590349}}. The GIS has been regularly updated since then. This database enabled MHRL to use a geographybased sampling method to recruit households from Bo city for this study. A two-stage cluster (neighbourhoodbased) sampling method was used to identify urban participants. First, seven of 68 sections (neighbourhoods) in the city of Bo were randomly sampled, and then 30 households from each of those seven sections were randomly sampled for participation. In the rural areas, 23 rural communities (villages) were randomly sampled for participation from a list of the 1,266 villages in Bo District. Interviewers visited these communities to recruit participants. When fewer than 30 households were located within the community, interviewers visited residences at the periphery of the villages until they had contacted 30 households. In total, 824 of the 900 (91.6%) contacted households participated in the study, including 667 of 690 (96.7%) rural households and 157 of 210 (74.8%) urban households.",
              "In each of the 824 participating households, one adult representative (age 18 or older) was asked to participate in a study of attitudes and practices related to malaria testing. The interviewers preferentially recruited household members who said they were febrile at the time of data collection. In both the urban and rural areas, the interviewers alternated between asking to interview a female household member and requesting an interview with a male household member. If an adult of the preferred gender was not available, a household member of the opposite gender was interviewed instead. Responses to interviewer questions were recorded in an OpenData-Kit questionnaire installed on smartphones. All interviews were completed between 14 December, 2013 and 31 January, 2014."

Those with a preference for home-based testing were more likely than those with a preference for laboratory-based testing to say that they did not need a test because they already knew the cause of the fever (p = 0.025). Urban non-testers were significantly more likely than rural non-testers to assume that they already knew the cause of the fever (p = <0.001) and to say that they did not want to wait for test results (p = 0.010).

              "Expanded access to CCM might improve access to diagnosis and appropriate, timely and cost-efficient treatment. Existing CHV networks in Sierra Leone could provide a foundation for intensifying CCM. The success of home-based testing in these communities would likely be dependent on (1) a high level of respect for and trust in new and existing CHVs by the communities they support; (2) the availability of a strong network of CHVs who are confident in their own RDT skills and are able to conduct tests themselves as well as teach others to conduct tests; (3) sufficient public health resources to support 'train-the-trainer' sessions to teach CHVs how to coach their neighbours through their first self/family malaria tests; and, (4) a competitive price point for home test kits when compared to the out-of-pocket costs of laboratory-based testing.",
              "The possible importance of home-based self-testing has been highlighted by the recent Ebola outbreak. In the months after this survey was conducted, hundreds of cases of Ebola occurred in Bo district {{26074854}}{{not_in_s2orc}}. Many clinics and hospitals in Bo closed their doors rather than risk exposing their staff to the Ebola virus, and others were forced to temporarily close because of quarantines. Laboratory-based testing for febrile illnesses became more difficult to conduct and more costly due to the need to assume that all biological specimens could be from a patient with Ebola, even when the most likely diagnosis was something more common and much less fatal. Quarantines meant that some CHVs in rural areas could not travel from their home villages to neighbouring ones or stopped volunteering because they feared contracting Ebola. Thus, access to routine medical care, including diagnosis and treatment of common infections such as malaria, decreased significantly, especially in rural areas that already had limited access to health services. Home-based testing that allows trained individuals with suspected malaria to test themselves and family members at home, thus limiting the exposure of others to their blood, could improve the home-based care that has become necessary for many households as a result of the strain Ebola put on the entire healthcare system of Sierra Leone."

Home-based malaria testing, often with the assistance of a CHV, has been successfully implemented in other sub-Saharan African communities.

                "Firstly, the study found that the majority of rural residents (69%) preferred a self/family- or community health volunteer (CHV)-conducted home-based malaria test, while 20% preferred a laboratory-based test. Similarly, among urban residents, 38% preferred a self/family- or CHV-conducted test, while 44% preferred a laboratory-based test. These findings suggest that there is a strong preference for home-based testing among the population, which could be due to the convenience and comfort of testing in one's own home.",
                "Secondly, the study found that if offered a home-based test, 28% of rural residents would prefer a self/family-conducted test, while 68% would prefer a CHV-assisted test. For urban residents, these numbers were 21% and 77%, respectively. This suggests that while some individuals may be comfortable performing the test themselves, many others prefer the assistance of a trained healthcare professional.",
                "Thirdly, the study found that only 36% of rural and 63% of urban residents reported usually taking a diagnostic test to confirm suspected malaria. The most common reasons for not seeking malaria testing were the cost of testing, waiting to see if the fever resolved on its own, and not wanting to travel to a clinical facility for a test. These findings suggest that there may be barriers to accessing malaria testing, which could be addressed through the use of home-based tests.",
                "Finally, the study found that 56% of rural and 33% of urban participants said they would pay more for a home-based test than a laboratory-based test. This suggests that there is a willingness to pay for the convenience and comfort of home-based testing.",
                "Overall, the study suggests that expanding community case management of malaria to include home testing by CHVs and family members may increase the proportion of individuals with febrile illnesses who confirm a positive diagnosis prior to initiating treatment. This could potentially improve malaria diagnosis and treatment outcomes in the study area. However, further research is needed to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of home-based malaria testing in different settings and to identify the best strategies for implementing and promoting this approach."

The finding that 32% of rural and 27% of urban participants were very confident they could perform a malaria test on themselves or a family member without assistance is particularly noteworthy. This suggests that cost and convenience may be significant barriers to accessing malaria testing in rural areas.",

                "The study aimed to investigate malaria testing practices and preferences in Bo, Sierra Leone, focusing on the feasibility of home-based rapid diagnostic tests administered by community health volunteers (CHVs) or trained family members. The results indicate a higher preference for home-based testing in rural households, with 69% opting for self/family- or CHV-conducted tests, and 20% choosing laboratory-based testing. In contrast, urban residents preferred laboratory-based testing (44%) and had a lower willingness to conduct tests at home (21% preferring self/family-assisted tests and 77% preferring CHV-assisted tests).",
                "Interestingly, the study found that 36% of rural and 63% of urban residents reported taking diagnostic tests to confirm suspected malaria, with the most common reasons being the cost of testing, waiting for the fever to resolve on its own, and reluctance to travel to clinical facilities. The results also suggest that rural residents are less confident in their ability to perform a malaria test on themselves or a family member without assistance (32%) and after training (50%), whereas urban residents showed higher confidence (62% and 33%, respectively).",
