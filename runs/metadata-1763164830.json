    "abstract": "There has been a substantially increased interest in biomedical research impact assessment over the past 5 years. This can be studied by a number of methods, but its influence on clinical guidelines must rank as one of the most important. In cancer, there are 43 UK guidelines (and associated Health Technology Assessments) published (up to October 2006) across three series, each of which has an evidence base in the form of references, many of which are papers in peer-reviewed journals. These have all been identified and analysed to determine their geographical provenance and type of research, in comparison with overall oncology research published in the peak years of guideline references (1999\u20132001). The UK papers were cited nearly three times as frequently as would have been expected from their presence in world oncology research (6.5%). Within the United Kingdom, Edinburgh and Glasgow stood out for their unexpectedly high contributions to the guidelines' scientific base. The cited papers from the United Kingdom acknowledged much more explicit funding from all sectors than did the UK cancer research papers at the same research level.",
    "discussion": "The UK cancer clinical guidelines are sufficient in number and variety to provide a fair window on the impact of cancer research on clinical practice, not only in the United Kingdom, but in other leading countries, particularly in western Europe. We have seen that almost all the references (88%) are to papers that are within the subfield of cancer research. Because about one-third of the research supported by Cancer Research UK, in common with that of other medical research charities working in a particular disease area, is out with this subfield (most of this would comprise basic biology), it follows that little of this work can be expected to influence clinical guidelines -hardly a surprising conclusion, but nevertheless one that is worth stating.Many of the guideline references are to papers in the US and the UK general medical journals -The Journal of the American Medical Association, New England Journal Medical, British Medical Journal and The Lancet. This is one reason, but by no means the only one, for the guideline references as a whole to be in high impact, and therefore well known, journals. It appears that if researchers want their work, particularly clinical trials, to be part of the evidence base for clinical guidelines, then it is desirable for them to publish in highly cited journals. Disproportionately, many of these papers will have been funded by government or the pharmaceutical industry, with charities also playing an enhanced role compared with cancer research overall. This highlights one pitfall of national guidelines in the context of research impact assessments; many important, high quality clinical trials -either because they are early phase or negative -will not make it into guidelines. The impact of research on national clinical guidelines is just one parameter that can describe the utility of health research {{9662045}} Table 4.When account is taken of the clinical nature of the work cited on guidelines, the big increase in the percentage of the papers that acknowledge funding -whether from government, charities or industry -is striking (Table 5). Many (37%) of these clinical papers with RLs greater than 1.5 are reports of clinical trials, and 85% of the latter acknowledge funding compared with 71% of the others. Cancer Research UK plays the biggest role, and supports over one-third of these trials, more even than the pharmaceutical industry as a whole, or the UK government.The geographical analysis of the cited papers reveals that the UK papers have a threefold higher presence among them than in world cancer research. In part, this reflects the differences in cancer management between countries. Such overcitation also occurs on other scientific papers, so it is hardly surprising that it was found here. It might be expected that the UK guidelines, which aim to show which treatments are cost-effective, would reflect in particular the different financial basis of health-care provision in this country compared with that elsewhere, and so papers concerned with economics and costs would be even more overcited if they were from the United Kingdom. In fact, this does occur, but to a very minor extent (22% from the United Kingdom compared with 19% overall; the difference not being significant).The distribution of the cited papers within the United Kingdom differs from what might have been expected based purely on overall numbers and on the extent to which the cities carry out clinical observation rather than basic research. The simple comparison of Figure 4 needs also to take account of the mean RL of papers from each area, and, when this is done ( Figure 5), a different pattern emerges, with EH \u00bc Edinburgh, OX \u00bc Oxford and CB \u00bc Cambridge forming an axis of excellence (on this indicator) and other areas' output being less cited on guidelines. The distance of the spots from this axis gives one indicator of the performance of the different centres, an imperfect one to be sure, as there will be other confounding factors not considered here, but nevertheless a useful complement to the traditional bibliometric criterion based purely on citation counts in the scientific literature.There are in the database enough cited papers from a few other countries to enable a similar evaluation to be carried out for them. However, these data are inevitably skewed by being viewed through the prism of the UK clinical recommendations. It would be highly desirable to complement them with the results of similar exercises carried out in other countries with extensive sets of clinical guidelines, or at a European or international level. Then, provided the data were collected in exactly the same way, they could be pooled and a more international perspective on the utility of cancer research would emerge that research evaluators could employ. Such an activity could appropriately be coordinated by the European Cancer Managers' Research Forum, with all data contributors having also the right to gain access to the data provided by workers in other countries.",

In this paper, we study the mapping between known solutions of the Euclidean O(3) non\u2010linear sigma model, such as instantons, merons and elliptic solutions that interpolate between the latter, and solutions of the Pohlmeyer reduced theory, namely the sinh\u2010Gordon equation. It turns out that instantons do not have a counterpart, merons correspond to the ground state, while the class of elliptic solutions is characterized by a two to one correspondence between solutions in the two descriptions.",
    "discussion": "We found the corresponding counterparts of meron and elliptic solutions of Euclidean O(3) non-linear sigma model in the Pohlmeyer reduced version of the same theory, namely the sinh-Gordon equation. Summarizing, we may conclude the following: Instanton solutions, which are the only finite action solutions of the O(3) model, do not have a counterpart, as they are characterized by vanishing stress-energy tensor. Therefore, not every solution of the non-linear sigma model has a counterpart in the Pohlmeyer reduced theory. Especially solutions with a well defined topological number cannot be mapped to the Pohlmeyer reduced theory, as they have to be characterized by a unique limit at complex infinity, which is inconsistent with the form of the imposed Virasoro constraint in Pohlmeyer reduction.All meron solutions correspond to the ground state of the sinh-Gordon equation. It seems that this is a more general property that singular configurations such as a meron have. In a similar manner, strings propagating into R t \u00d7 S 2 are described by a non-linear sigma model that is reducible to the sine-Gordon equation. Classical string solutions that are singular in a similar sense (the world-sheet tends to an onedimensional manifold, such as a point particle solution, or the \"hoop\" string solution) have the property of being mapped to either the stable or the unstable vacuum of the sine-Gordon equation {{12750838}}.Elliptic solutions, which can be viewed as solutions of an one-dimensional mechanical pendulum problem in the initial formulation of the theory, have also an onedimensional mechanical analogue with a hyperbolic cosine potential in the Pohlmeyer reduced description. For every periodic solution in the pendulum problem, there is a quasi-periodic solution and vice versa that has the same counterpart in the hyperbolic cosine problem. The above pair of solutions correspond to physically distinct solutions in the initial formulation of the sigma model. Furthermore, different, physically inequivalent solutions of the sigma model may correspond to the same solution in the Pohlmeyer reduced theory. This may be attributed to the fact that Pohlmeyer reduction deals with the fields and their derivatives in a symmetric way, as elements of a vector basis in an enhanced higher dimensional space, in our case R 3 .It would be interesting to generalize these results studying the correspondence between solutions of non-linear sigma models with different target space geometries or in higher dimensional target spaces.",

    "discussion": "Overall, the distributional similarity between the target word and the synonym candidates represents the strongest extension of the basic retranslation approach, and the cluster graphs do not provide further useful information. A breakdown of the cluster analyses revealed that the cluster sizes are very unevenly distributed. Typically, there is one very large cluster and several considerably smaller clusters, as shown by the first part of  Table 4: Distribution of candidates, synonyms and senses in the largest cluster vs. all other clusters in the iterations T 1 -T 5 .proportion of candidates in the remaining clusters.In addition, we found that most correct synonyms are also in the largest cluster (middle part of table 4). Accordingly, the cluster analyses do not represent partitions of the target verb senses, but most senses are in the largest cluster (bottom part of table 4).Consequently, while the synonym features are useful for ranking the set of candidates, clusterlevel features are ineffective as they are derived from effectively meaningless cluster analyses. 4 While re-applying the clustering step gradually overcomes the uneven cluster distribution (iterations T 2 -T 5 in table 4), the sizes of the graphs decrease dramatically. For example (not depicted in table 4), on average there are only 169 candidates left in T 5 compared to 1,792 in T 1 , with an average of 2.8 correct synonyms instead of 22.5, and an average of 1.7 senses instead of 4.5.We assume that partitioning the candidate set according to senses in combination with the cluster-level measures is a valid approach to deal with the word sense problem, but based on our analysis we conclude that either (i) the context vectors are not suitable to differentiate between senses, or that (ii) the clustering algorithm is inapt for this scenario. A possible solution might be to apply the algorithms suggested in {{11942888}}. Finally, no weighting was applied to any of the properties listed in table 2. This could be improved by using a held-out data development set, and a greater number of particle verbs (we only use 138) would probably be needed as well.We hypothesized that graph-based clustering properties in addition to synonym candidate properties should improve the precision of synonym identification and ranking, and extend the diversity of synonym senses. Unfortunately, our extensions failed, and analyses of cluster properties revealed that future work should improve the vector representations and compare other clustering algorithms. One should keep in mind, however, that we focused on a specifically challenging class of multi-word expressions: highly ambiguous German particle verbs.",

A rapid rule-out of VAP should allow for discontinuation of antibiotics on the day of suspicion of VAP and therefore improve antibiotic management. This randomised controlled trial aims to determine the clinical utility of a rapid biomarker-based test by measuring the antibiotic use, which is expressed as AFD, in the 7 days that follow BAL.Few biomarkers are used in the ICU to guide antibiotic management, and none specifically for VAP.

Among urban residents, these numbers were 38% and 44%, respectively. If offered a home-based test, 28% of rural residents would prefer a self/family-conducted test and 68% would prefer a CHV-assisted test. For urban residents, these numbers were 21% and 77%. In total, 36% of rural and 63% of urban residents reported usually taking a diagnostic test to confirm suspected malaria. The most common reasons for not seeking malaria testing were the cost of testing, waiting to see if the fever resolved on its own, and not wanting to travel to a clinical facility for a test. In total, 32% of rural and 27% of urban participants were very confident they could perform a malaria test on themselves or a family member without assistance, 50% of rural and 62% of urban participants were very confident they could perform a test after training, and 56% of rural and 33% of urban participants said they would pay more for a home-based test than a laboratory-based test.ConclusionExpanding community case management of malaria to include home testing by CHVs and family members may increase the proportion of individuals with febrile illnesses who confirm a positive diagnosis prior to initiating treatment.",
    "discussion": "The participants in this study, especially those living in rural areas, expressed a high level of interest in homebased testing for malaria. A recent systematic review of Table 3 Characteristics of participants who indicated a consistent preference for home-based testing (by self/family or CHV) or laboratory-based testing 27 studies of CCM of malaria found consistent evidence that trained CHWs could successfully conduct RDTs and use the test results to recommend appropriate treatment {{74007}}. Studies in which community members are part of the selection process for CHVs are particularly successful in increasing access to testing {{18750996}}{{6084901}}. The primary concerns about CCM of malaria are some CHWs recommending anti-malarial medications following negative malaria tests and many febrile individuals not following through on recommended clinical consultations after negative test results {{74007}}{{10253380}}. Few studies have examined the use of home-based RDTs conducted by family members trained and supervised by CHVs rather than by the CHVs themselves, but this study suggested an openness to self/family testing in addition to CHV testing. Self/family testing with RDTs prepurchased by the household might increase malariatesting access in small farming villages that are located farther than easy walking distance from a community with a trained CHV. Home-based malaria testing, often with the assistance of a CHV, has been successfully implemented in other sub-Saharan African communities. In the rural Iganga district of Uganda, community members expressed a high level of trust in CHVs who were trained to conduct malaria RDTs and to recommend appropriate malaria treatment {{7359381}}. In villages in the South Kordofan State of Sudan, the use of CHV-conducted RDTs significantly increased access to malaria tests and malaria treatment, especially during the rainy season when travel to a clinic was often impossible {{6084901}}. In two provinces in Zambia, CHVs had a very high rate of correct recommendations for malaria treatment or referral to a healthcare facility after conducting in-home RDTs {{18750996}}. Given the substantial interest in home-based malaria testing in rural Bo district in Sierra Leone, it seems likely that CHVs in these communities could successfully test and treat malaria in homes, and perhaps even train willing and confident family members to conduct RDTs in their own households, making appropriate referrals for hospital care when necessary.The most commonly reported barriers to the uptake of home-based testing for malaria include concerns about infection transmission during blood draws {{7359381}}{{30384887}} and concerns about reliable access to RDTs for homebased testing use {{18750996}}{{10253380}}{{1841654}}. Any programme for homebased testing would need to include clear instructions about how to safely dispose of lancets and test kits. CHVs could be encouraged to collect used kits they had distributed and to ensure that they were processed as medical waste. Consistent access to RDTs would need to be supported through community partnerships with local hospitals and government health officials.This study in Sierra Leone used a cross-sectional approach with self-reported answers about febrile status and testing preferences. Participants were not asked to try conducting a malaria test on themselves or a family member, so all answers about willingness to conduct a test and confidence about the ability to conduct a test are hypothetical. This willingness-to-test survey will need to be followed by field tests of RDTs by CHVs and CHV-trained family members. Should these tests prove to be acceptable to the community, safe and valid, the programme could be expanded to include RDTs for other locally-important infections.",

Our construction gives interactive proofs for all languages in BQP with a polynomial number of quantum provers, each of which, in the honest case, performs only a single measurement. \nOur techniques use self-tested graph states. In this regard we introduce two important improvements over previous work. Specifically, we derive new error bounds which scale polynomially with the size of the graph compared with exponential dependence on the size of the graph in previous work. We also extend the self-testing error bounds on measurements to a very general set which includes the adaptive measurements used for measurement-based quantum computation as a special case.",
    "discussion": "For our result to hold, we must assume that the provers behave according to quantum mechanics. This is because we model the provers using the quantum formalism. Currently this appears to be a reasonable assumption since quantum mechanics has been a very successful theory. However, we run into a problem if we wish to use this result in certain circumstances. For example, we may wish to verify that quantum mechanics generates accurate predictions for very complex systems. In this case it becomes infeasible to classically compute predictions from the quantum model. Quantumly, this is still possible, and we might be tempted to use an interactive proof in order to verify that our quantum computer has done the computation correctly. However, if we use the arguments in this paper we run into a problem of circularity since we must assume that quantum mechanics is correct in order for the argument to go through, but quantum mechanics is exactly what we want to verify! Hence it remains an important open question whether it is possible to achieve interactive proofs for problems in BQP where the prover's actions are easy for quantum computers but for which we do not assume a priori that quantum mechanics holds.As discussed in the proof of Theorem 1, there are space-time trade-offs. In particular we may perform the gap amplification by repeating in parallel or serially, or some mixture of the two. Hence we could perform N repetitions on n provers, each of which then performs N measurements, or we can repeat in parallel with nN provers, each of which performs a single measurement.Another factor, which we have not mentioned, is the time required to build the necessary graph states. Graph states are built by applying CTRL-Z gates, one for each edge. At worst this can take no more than O(n 2 ) operations. For triangular cluster states, such as we use here, the degree of each vertex in bounded above by 6 so at most 3n 2-qubit operations are required (plus n single-qubit state preparations). These can be parallelized in a constant depth circuit by exploiting the localized structure of triangular cluster states. Regardless, the state preparation can be accomplished in a polynomial number of steps.Our construction has a somewhat remarkable property. Since triangular cluster states are universal, the state preparation depends only on the size of the calculation. By choosing a discrete set of operations (X, Z and X \u00b1 Z measurements are sufficient for universality) the quantum provers are also constant, requiring only the ability to measure in some fixed set of bases. The self-testing portion of the interactive proof then also only depends on the size of the calculation, since it depends only on the state and the measurements. Amazingly the classical verifier is also rather simple. It can be given a circuit as its input from which it reads off what gates to perform and simply looks up what angle to measure for that gate. The remaining calculations are simply XORs. This is a clear example of where the simplicity of the measurementbased quantum computing model allows for a simple analysis.Another interesting property is that no single quantum prover has enough power to convince even itself whether the input is in the language. Indeed, all the quantum parts together, including the state preparation, still cannot perform even simple calculations since they can only prepare and measure some fixed state. They lack the capacity to perform the XORs required to perform a full measurement-based calculation. It is only when we combine the verifier, provers, and state preparation together that we obtain enough power to perform any substantial calculations.It should be possible, although a bit more involved, to use the usual graph state computation model {{8839192}}{{6197709}} involving X-Y plane measurements. There is a complication since it is possible to simulate a complex measurements M by using a M * measurements instead (i.e. complex conjugate everything). In other words, the provers could complex conjugate all their states and operators, and this would preserve the expected values of all operators. However, the complex conjugation cannot be \"undone\" through an isometry. Hence the complex conjugated provers would not satisfy equation (22).As far as correctness of the calculation is concerned, complex conjugation poses no problem since the outcome of an adaptive measurement will be identical to the desired case. A workaround is possible through a suitable relaxation of (22), and details are given for the exact case in {{44939389}}. The remaining points are to make the techniques of {{44939389}} robust, and generalize to X-Y plane measurements, which can be done analogously to how X-Z plane measurements are handled here.",

The source of this fibronectin is critical to understanding the mechanisms underlying tissue repair. This study demonstrates that the proliferating microvascular vessels surrounding excisional wounds produce fibronectin in situ. The use of reciprocal species-specific antibodies further confirms that the fibronectin is produced by the rat vessels and not derived from circulating mouse plasma. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the role of microvascular fibronectin in tissue repair and angiogenesis. The production of microvascular fibronectin by proliferating vessels may play a key role in the formation of new blood vessels and the regulation of the healing process."

    "abstract": "Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis detects regions of a genome that are linked to a complex trait. Once a QTL is detected, the region is narrowed by positional cloning in the hope of determining the underlying candidate gene\u2014methods used include creating congenic strains, comparative genomics and gene expression analysis. Combined cross analysis may also be used for species such as the mouse, if the QTL is detected in multiple crosses. This process involves the recoding of QTL data on a per-chromosome basis, with the genotype recoded on the basis of high- and low-allele status. The data are then combined and analyzed; a successful analysis results in a narrowed and more significant QTL. Using parallel methods, we show that it is possible to narrow a QTL by combining data from two different species, the rat and the mouse. We combined standardized high-density lipoprotein phenotype values and genotype data for the rat and mouse using information from one rat cross and two mouse crosses. We successfully combined data within homologous regions from rat Chr 6 onto mouse Chr 12, and from rat Chr 10 onto mouse Chr 11. The combinations and analyses resulted in QTL with smaller confidence intervals and increased logarithm of the odds ratio scores. The numbers of candidate genes encompassed by the QTL on mouse Chr 11 and 12 were reduced from 1343 to 761 genes and from 613 to 304 genes, respectively. This is the first time that QTL data from different species were successfully combined; this method promises to be a useful tool for narrowing QTL intervals.",
    "discussion": "Previously, genotype data from multiple mouse QTL datasets were successfully combined; if the QTL genes are the same, or close to each other with the same mode of inheritance and the same direction of the allele effect, the combined analysis results in higher LOD scores and narrower QTL. Using the same methodology, we combined HDL QTL datasets from two different species, the rat and mouse. Both combinations resulted in a successful increase in statistical significance and a narrowing of the QTL confidence interval. More importantly than the positional effects, however, this narrowing reduced the number of underlying candidate genes. The mouse QTL on Chr 11 was narrowed from a confidence interval spanning 41 cM to one spanning 17 cM, and the QTL on Chr 12 was reduced from 44 to 22 cM. The numbers of underlying candidate genes were reduced by 43 and 54 percent, respectively.These results are the first report of a successful combination of QTL data from two different species. While the methodology involved in combining cross data was not novel, the steps required to prepare the datasets for combination were thoroughly researched and tested by us and may now be repeated. It is notable that in clarifying the steps required for aligning rat and mouse QTL at the marker level, several factors normally considered in QTL analysis were omitted for simplicity and for the value of testing by assumption. We designed the data combinations so that sex, diet or any other condition were cofactors only in addition to species, i.e., the datasets may have been from different species and different sexes, but one dataset never included both male and female mice. Diet significantly contributes to lipid metabolism, and the rats and mice from the different crosses were not fed identical diets or for the same time periods prior to phenotyping (see materials and methods), but its effects were not considered in this study. In implementing this procedure for actual positional cloning, a model with multiple cofactors should be used.If QTL for the same trait are found in more than one species, it is common when narrowing the QTL to eliminate regions within the QTL that are not homologous to QTL regions for the same trait in the other species. This is especially true when the two species in comparison are extensively studied, as in humans and mice, or when the two species are very closely related, as among rodents. We recommend that in parallel or in conjunction with combining QTL data from multiple crosses within a species, combining QTL data from different species maybe be used along with all other QTL narrowing techniques, including cross-specific haplotyping and genome-wide association studies based on all strains. As previously suggested {{14076080}}, combining crosses complements the meta-analysis of QTL significance values.Although rat and mouse are closely related rodents, this study represents a useful approach for combining data from other species, even from less related species, like mouse and human -if the species are extensively studied and if there is an appropriate arrangement of contiguous loci, as required in the selection of the datasets combined in this analysis. In attempting a mouse-human study, we would need to address the differences in overall metabolism in theoretical speculation as well as in data analysis. For example, in humans, females on average have higher HDL cholesterol than males, but in mice the opposite relationship is true. Such sex or other covariate differences in physiology are usually considered after one-species analyses are complete, when individual candidate genes are investigated. In combining QTL data within a species, we assume that allelic effects are parallel, which allows us to combine the data. A successful combination, i.e., the achievement of a higher LOD and narrower confidence interval, provides substantial evidence that the two QTL share the same underlying gene. We have shown that such success is possible with two closely related species, and because the rat and mouse are both closely related and physiologically similar, it is not a far stretch to draw the same conclusion. If the two species were different regarding HDL metabolism, as in mice and humans, narrowing the QTL by combined data analysis suggests the same underlying gene. However, because the physiological differences are not considered in the combined QTL analysis, any successful combination is based on a multi-dimensional assumption. The underlying differences in physiology are so complex in their polygenicity and dependent pathways that the data analysis would possibly need to coincide with physiological modeling. It may be possible to quantify metabolic differences between species based on such modeling and then standardize the phenotype prior to combining QTL data accordingly.In addition to metabolic differences, genomic function at the level of recombination must be considered. In the analysis presented here, homologous QTL with an underlying contiguous sequence of loci were combined. Because differences in recombination rate between the rat and mouse were not taken into account during the analysis, a likely result is the skewing of the genetic map created in the context of the mouse. Recombination rates should be consulted as data from more divergent species are combined.In summary, sex, diet, species, physiology and genomic differences are all factors to consider when analyzing combined QTL datasets.In the examples we present, we use a simplified one-covariate model, encompassing all possible differences between the two datasets. Most importantly, we have described detailed methods for combining datasets from two different species. The successful combinations we achieved reveal a promising addition to the process of QTL narrowing. Had a combination not been successful, we would not have been able to declare that the individual QTL were species-specific as they could also be diet-, physiology-, sex-(in one case) or genome structure -specific. We recommend using a multi-covariate model when analyzing combined datasets for QTL-narrowing.Advances in comparative genomics contribute greatly to the understanding of animal development and physiology. Incorporating such knowledge is essential for the construction of genomes, proteomes and metabolic networks, and for theorizing and elucidating the mechanisms of molecular and phenotypic evolution. Now, the near completion of entire genome homology maps, like the one available between the rat and mouse, allows for the ability to combine data in a way that is useful both intellectually and statistically. The methods introduced here recognize the decade-long explosion of empirical advancements and the resulting field of bioinformatics.Beyond the alignment of homologous markers and genes, the integration of the QTL data for analysis adds a new level to species homology because theories of shared physiology may be tested mathematically. While statistical significance is both arbitrary and necessary for experimental validity, the increase in statistical significance (LOD) seen in these combinations is overshadowed by the potential insight gained into the underlying shared genome organization. The candidate genes underlie the QTL, but the replication and expression of those genes are dictated by the underlying DNA sequence and chromosome mechanics.  Rat-mouse concordance between cholesterol QTL on two different chromosomes. Genetic maps for rat chromosomes are shown on the left and for mouse chromosomes on the right. Rat markers names are shown in alignment with their genetic positions on the rat genome, and with their homologous positions on the mouse genome. The grey boxes show the original (pre-combination) QTL confidence interval for each species; the black bar represents the QTL peak. The LOD score for each QTL is shown adjacent to the peak. (A) Rat WxDA chr 6 male (most left) and female QTL are aligned with mouse BxD2 Chr 12 QTL. The most proximal rat marker (D6Pas1) is homologous to mouse Chr 17. The remaining markers align to mouse chromosome 12 contiguously. The female rat data was not chosen for this combination as the rat peak positions are not within the rat/mouse overlapping regions. (B) Rat WxDA Chr 10 female QTL is aligned with the mouse PxD2 Chr 11 female QTL. The region immediately surrounding the most distal rat marker, D10Mgh2, is not homologous to the mouse genome; the other markers align to mouse Chr 11 contiguously.

    "discussion": "Using the ELEARN dataset, forgetting mechanisms provide clear improvements in recall immediately after a sudden drift, except with IBFF, where slight improvements are only obtained with high fading factors (slow forgetting).However, the same is not observable in any case with the MUSIC dataset.With this dataset, immediately after the occurrence of a drift, improvements are not observed, but relative degradation is also not present.This contradicts results obtained with synthesized datasets that suggest a better capability to adapt to sudden drifts.A number of factors can influence the behavior of the algorithms, namely the presence of natural drifts and the natural variability of the datasets.This motivates further research to understand how dataset inherent features such as natural variability and the occurrence of sudden and gradual drifts relate to forgetting parameters such as window length and fading factor values.With nonincremental algorithms (UBSW/UBGW and IBSW/IBGW), the first observation is that the sliding window algorithms tend to maintain an approximately constant time to rebuild the matrix, while with growing window algorithms time increases throughout the experiment.This is a natural consequence of the use of fixed length windows.The number of sessions to process, in the case of UBSW and IBSW, is fixed, which leads to approximately constant time.Gains in scalability are the most evident motivation for the use of sliding windows.Also, with nonincremental algorithms, it is noticeable that time is steadier with the user-based versions than with the item-based versions.One explanation for this is that both datasets have a sequential unique session per user, which Time with the use of fading factors in incremental algorithms seems to be unaffected with ELEARN and MU-SIC, but using a longer dataset, it becomes more evident that fading factors also have the potential to improve scalability.With fading factors, older similarity values tend to zero, but it takes a large amount of sessions for similarities to actually become zero.The package spam optimizes sparse matrix storage by storing only values greater than 2.220446 \u00d7 10 \u221216 {{44515378}}.For example, with \u03b1 = 0.97, a similarity value of 0.5, if never updated by recent data, only gets completely \"forgotten\" (i.e., becomes zero) after 1,170 sessions, which is more than the number of sessions in both ELEARN and MUSIC.User-based algorithms produce smaller matrices when the number of users is lower than the number of items and larger matrices when the number of users exceeds the number of items.Time to rebuild and/or update these matrices is directly affected by the amount of data to process.This explains why user-based algorithms perform better with the MUSIC dataset, while item-based algorithms have better results with ELEARN.",

    "abstract": "Activity of the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (CAT), which mediates the synthesis of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, was increased up to 20- fold in spinal cord (SC) cells grown in culture with muscle cells for 2 wk. This increase was directly related to the duration of co-culture as well as to the cell density of both the SC and muscle involved and was not affected by the presence of the acetylcholine receptor blocking agent, \u03b1-bungarotoxin. Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity was often markedly decreased in SC-muscle cultures while the activities of acetylcholinesterase and several other enzymes were little changed. Increased CAT activity was also observed when SC cultures were maintained in medium which had been conditioned by muscle cells or by undifferentiated cells from embryonic muscle. Muscle-conditioned medium (CM) did not affect the activities of SC cell GAD or acetylcholinesterase. Dilution or concentration of the CM directly affected its ability to increase SC CAT activity , as did the duration and timing of exposure of the SC cells to the CM. The medium could be conditioned by muscle cells in the presence or absence of serum, and remained effective after dialysis or heating to 58 degrees C. Membrane filtration data were consistent with the conclusion that the active material(s) in CM had a molecular weight in excess of 50,000 daltons. We conclude that large molecular weight material that is released by muscle cells is capable of producing a specific increase in CAT activity of SC cells.",
    "discussion": "We have found that growth of SC cells with cultured muscle cells resulted in markedly increased CAT activity. We have previously re-ported (4) that co-culture of SC and muscle cells did not increase either the number of identifiable neurons or the activity of several other enzymes. Indeed, the transmitter-related enzyme, GAD, was decreased under some conditions of co-culture. The increase in SC cell CAT activity was directly dependent on the muscle and SC cell density in culture, as well as the duration of coculture. We did not obtain a saturation of the response by increasing the quantity of muscle in co-culture with SC. Muscle CM also increased SC cell CAT activity by as much as 10-fold within 3 wk, while it did not affect the activity of GAD or acetylcholinesterase. The CAT activity increase produced by muscle CM was directly dependent upon the CM concentration and the interval of exposure. The factor(s) in muscle CM responsible for increasing the SC cell CAT activity was heat stable at 58~ and nondialyzable; membrane filtration data were consistent with the factor's having a molecular weight greater than 50,000 daltons. It seems reasonable to suppose that muscle grown in co-culture conditioned the medium as did muscle grown alone; and, thus, a substantial part of the increase in CAT activity observed in co-cultures was probably produced by mechanisms similar to those in the experiments with CM. It is valid to ask whether any additional factors are provided by the contiguity of SC cells and muscle in co-cultures. Physiologically effective synaptic interaction between nerve and muscle is not involved in the increased CAT activity in co-cultures, since the increase was not affected by the presence of c~-bungarotoxin. Our experiments provide no evidence for any effect on CAT activity requiring some other aspect of nervemuscle contact, but such an effect cannot be excluded as a basis for some component of the increase seen with nerve and muscle co-cultures.The experiments with CM demonstrated that one or more macromolecules released by myogenic cells act to increase the CAT activity of SC cells. Several questions naturally arise with regard to this phenomenon. (a) Are myogenic cells the only source for the active molecules or can more than one tissue serve as a source? (b) Is CAT activity of the nerve cell culture affected in a relatively specific manner or is the effect a general one on culture growth? (c) Is the stimulation of CAT activity the effect of a single interaction between CM factor and recipient cell, or is it due to multiple small additive effects? (d) Does * SC cells were cultured alone in freshly prepared medium, in medium conditioned for 2-3 days by muscle cells, or co-cultured with muscle. Cultures were harvested at the end of the treatment intervals and the CAT activity was assayed independently in cells pooled from 2-4 dishes (35 mm) in Exp A (expressed as mean -+ SD) or from two 60mm culture dishes (Exp B). The increases in CAT activity were calculated as in Table I. :~ Differ from 3-13 at P > 0.02. w Differ from 3-13 at P > 0.001.a similar regulatory interaction occur in vivo?The present work provides some information with regard to the first two questions. We have found that medium conditioned by SC cells, differentiated skeletal muscle, and undifferentiated cells of myogenic origin increased CAT activity of SC cell cultures. Because of the differences between these cultures in cell type, size, and density, and because of the uncertainty as to the amount of effective protein secreted by the cultures into the medium during conditioning, it is difficult to assess the relative efficacy of the different cell cultures in the production of the CM factor. It seems clear, however, that skeletal muscle is not the only source of material that can produce an increase in CAT activity in SC cell cultures.The co-culture and CM effects exhibited considerable specificity with regard to the enzyme changes produced in the SC cultures. In the experiment in Fig. 3, we assayed for protein, DNA, CAT, acetylcholinesterase, creatine phosphokinase, phosphoglucomutase, myokinase, and phosphorylase. Of these, only CAT activity was substantially increased, while in that experiment and some others, GAD activity was reduced in co-cultures (Figs. 4 and 6 and Table I). When SC cells were treated with muscle CM, CAT activity was substantially increased while the activities of GAD and acetylcholinesterase were not. It is this specificity in enzyme response of SC cells to coculture or treatment with CM which distinguishes the interaction reported here from a relatively nonspecific promotion of cell survival {{85966459}}. The data on enzyme activities, total culture DNA, and culture protein indicate neither a substantial nonspecific increase in plating efficiency with coculture nor a facilitation of long-term survival with CM. The specific increase in CAT activity produced by both of these conditions indicates either that survival of a population of CAT-producing cells is selectively increased or that cell survival is unchanged and CAT production per cell is increased. Some combination of these processes might of course occur. The fact that CAT activity in co-culture continued to increase well after the activity in control cultures had become constant (Fig. 3 and Reference 4), argues against an increased survival in co-culture of a population of neurons in which the CAT activity increased at the same rate as that of surviving control cells. We previously reported that differences in the number of identifiable neuron-like cells were not detected between cultures of SC cells grown alone and SC grown with muscle, while 20-fold more CAT activity was present in the co-cultures (4). Thus, our results suggest that the increase in CAT activity that occurred in co-GILLER El' AL. Choline Acetyltransferase Activity of Spinal Cord Cell Cultures cultures resulted from an increase in the net production of this enzyme per cell. Until the cell of origin of the CAT activity is established, however, other mechanisms cannot be excluded. The specificity of the effect of both co-culture and CM on CAT activity suggests some relevance to trophic interactions in the neuromuscular or other cholinergic systems. Since this enzyme mediates the synthesis of acetylcholine at the synaptic junction between spinal motoneurons and skeletal muscle, the interaction in culture may reflect a significant neuromuscular regulatory process. The nature of the regulatory material(s) and its mechanism of action merit further investigation.",
