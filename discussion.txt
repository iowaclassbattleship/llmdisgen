Cervical cancer remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality among women, particularly in developing countries. Its status as the second most common cancer globally, and the leading cancer among Indian women, highlights the persistent public health challenge it poses [1]. The lack of organized screening programs in many low-resource settings contributes to delayed detection, with most patients presenting at tertiary care centers in advanced stages. This late presentation is a significant factor in treatment complexity and overall prognosis, consistent with findings from prior studies [2,3].

Early detection through routine screening has the potential to significantly reduce both incidence and mortality. Methods such as Pap smears and HPV DNA testing, combined with public health initiatives to raise awareness about cervical cancer symptoms and risk factors, could encourage women to seek timely medical care. Strengthening primary health care infrastructure to support these interventions is crucial, especially in rural or underserved regions.

Nevertheless, several challenges remain. Limited healthcare resources, socio-cultural barriers, and insufficient public health outreach make widespread screening and vaccination difficult to implement. Future strategies should focus on context-appropriate, cost-effective programs that integrate screening, vaccination, and education to maximize impact. Additionally, monitoring and evaluating the outcomes of these interventions will be essential to inform policy decisions.

In summary, the high burden of cervical cancer in developing countries underscores the urgent need for comprehensive prevention and early detection strategies. Coordinated efforts targeting awareness, screening, and vaccination can improve outcomes and reduce the diseaseâ€™s public health impact.
